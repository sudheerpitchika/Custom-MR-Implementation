@Panama:Economy

Economy-overview: Because of its key geographic location, Panama's
economy is service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce,
and tourism. Since taking office in 1994, President PEREZ BALLADARES
has advanced an economic reform program designed to liberalize the
trade regime, attract foreign investment, privatize state-owned
enterprises, institute fiscal reform, and encourage job creation
through labor code reform. The government privatized its two remaining
ports along the Panama Canal in 1997 and approved the sale of the
railroad in early 1998. It also plans to sell other assets, including
the electric company. Panama joined the World Trade Organization
(WTrO) and approved a tariff reduction that will give the country the
lowest average tariff rates in Latin America. A banking reform law was
approved by the legislature in early 1998 and will take effect in
June. After two years of near stagnation, the reforms are beginning to
take root; GDP grew by 3.6% in 1997 and is expected to grow by more
than 5% in 1998. The most important sectors driving growth have been
the Panama Canal and the shipping and port activities. The Colon Free
Zone also rebounded from a slow year in 1996.

@Papua New Guinea:Economy

Economy-overview: Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural
resources, but exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain
and the high cost of developing an infrastructure. Agriculture
provides a subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population.
Mineral deposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account for 72% of
export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid
under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. In 1995,
Port Moresby reached agreement with the IMF and World Bank on a
structural adjustment program, of which the first phase was
successfully completed in 1996. Droughts caused by the El Nino weather
pattern wreaked havoc on Papua New Guinea's coffee, cocoa, and coconut
production, the mainstays of the agricultural-based economy and major
sources of export earnings. The coffee crop was slashed by up to 50%
in 1997. Moreover, droughts could bite into growth in 1998.

@Paraguay:Economy

Economy-overview: Paraguay has a market economy marked by a large
informal sector. The informal sector features both reexport of
imported consumer goods (electronics, whiskeys, perfumes, cigarettes,
and office equipment) to neighboring countries as well as the
activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors.
The formal sector is largely oriented toward services. A large
percentage of the population derive their living from agricultural
activity, often on a subsistence basis. The formal economy has grown
an average of about 3% over the past five years. However, population
has increased at about the same rate over the same period, leaving per
capita income nearly stagnant. The WASMOSY government has continued to
pursue its economic reform agenda, albeit with limited success because
of in-fighting in the ruling party and resistance from the opposition.
Paraguay's ongoing integration into Mercosur (the Southern Cone Common
Market) offers potential for investment and growth.

@Peru:Economy

Economy-overview: The Peruvian economy has become increasingly
market-oriented, with major privatizations completed since 1990 in the
mining, electricity, and telecommunications industries. In the 1980s,
the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita output,
and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank
support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An
austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government
took office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly
contraction of economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late
that year, and in 1991 output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as
the austerity program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly
price increases eased to the single-digit level and by December 1991
dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima obtained a
financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991,
although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By
working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March
1993. In 1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual
El Nino current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish catch, but the
economy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped push growth to
7% in 1993, about 13% in 1994, and 6.8% in 1995. Growth slowed to
about 2.8% in 1996 as the government adopted tight fiscal and monetary
policy to reduce the current account deficit and meet its IMF targets.
Growth then rebounded to 7.3% in 1997 even as inflation fell to its
lowest level in 23 years. Capital inflows surged to record levels in
early 1997 and have remained strong despite economic shocks stemming
from the Asian financial crisis and the El Nino weather events.

@Philippines:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 the Philippine economy, primarily a mixture
of agriculture and light industry, continued its fifth year of
positive economic growth, led by expansion of exports and investment.
The government expects growth to slow to about 3% in 1998 due to
spillover effects of the financial crisis in East Asia. The government
has promised to continue its economic reforms to help the Philippines
match the pace of development in the newly industrialized countries of
East Asia. The strategy includes improving infrastructure, overhauling
the tax system to bolster government revenues, and moving toward
further deregulation and privatization of the economy.

@Poland:Economy

Economy-overview: Poland today stands out as one of the most
successful and open transition economies. The privatization of small
and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new
firms marked the rapid development of a private sector now responsible
for at least two-thirds of economic activity. In contrast to the
vibrant expansion of private non-farm activity, the large agriculture
component remains handicapped by structural problems, surplus labor,
inefficient small farms, and lack of investment. The government's
determination to enter the EU as soon as possible affects all aspects
of its economic policies. Improving Poland's worsening current account
deficit also is a priority. To date, the government has resisted
pressure for protectionist solutions and continues to support regional
free trade initiatives. The government export strategy emphasizes a
more aggressive export assistance program. Warsaw continues to hold
the budget deficit to less than 2% of GDP. Further progress on public
finance depends mainly on comprehensive reform of the social welfare
system and privatization of Poland's remaining state sector.
Restructuring and privatization of "sensitive sectors" (e.g., coal,
steel) has been delayed. Long-awaited privatizations in aviation,
energy, and telecommunications are scheduled for 1998.

@Portugal:Economy

Economy-overview: Portugal's short-term economic fundamentals remain
strong: 1997 was marked by a reduction in inflation, a rise in the GDP
growth rate, a reduction in the fiscal deficit, and a lowering of
interest rates. The Socialist government's primary economic goal is to
place Portugal in the initial group of countries adopting the single
European currency; Lisbon looks well positioned to be in the first
tranche of EMU countries. As for the long run, Portugal is increasing
its infrastructure spending, in anticipation of hosting the world's
International Exposition, which began in May 1998. Lisbon also is
working to modernize its capital plant and increase competitiveness in
hope of moving up closer to the EU average.

@Puerto Rico:Economy

Economy-overview: Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in
the Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has surpassed
agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income.
Encouraged by duty-free access to the US and by tax incentives, US
firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US minimum
wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and
other livestock products as the main source of income in the
agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important
source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of nearly 4
million tourists in 1993. The construction sector has been a key
factor in recent economic growth.

@Qatar:Economy

Economy-overview: Oil is the backbone of the economy and accounts for
more than 30% of GDP, roughly 70% of export earnings, and 66% of
government revenues. Proved oil reserves of 3.7 billion barrels should
ensure continued output at current levels for 23 years. Oil has given
Qatar a per capita GDP comparable to the leading West European
industrial countries. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 7
trillion cubic meters, more than 5% of the world total, third largest
in the world. Production and export of natural gas are becoming
increasingly important. Long-term goals feature the development of
off-shore petroleum and the diversification of the economy.

@Reunion:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy has traditionally been based on
agriculture. Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a
century, and in some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The
government has been pushing the development of a tourist industry to
relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of the
labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The
white and Indian communities are substantially better off than other
segments of the population, often approaching European standards,
whereas indigenous groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical
of the poorer nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe
rioting in February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic
tensions. The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on
continued financial assistance from France.

@Romania:Economy

Economy-overview: Romania, one of the poorer countries in the region,
is continuing its difficult transition to a market-based economy.
After the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 1989-91, Romania was left
with an obsolete industrial base and a pattern of industrial capacity
wholly unsuited to its needs. For the next few years the country
lagged behind most of its neighbors in the pace of restructuring. Then
in February 1997, Romania embarked on a comprehensive macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform program. The domestic foreign
exchange market was freed, and controls on current-account
convertibility were removed in October. Restructuring programs include
liquidating large energy-intensive industries, and agricultural and
financial sector reform. The private sector share of GDP rose to an
estimated 58% in 1997, however, this total includes firms with
government-held minority stakes. Although progress has been made in
privatizing small- and medium-sized firms, delays in structural
reforms-including the postponement of sales of large state-owned
enterprises - threaten plans to revive GDP growth. In 1998, GDP will
likely be unchanged; and inflation is projected to fall to 45% from
151% in 1997.

@Russia:Economy

Economy-overview: Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural
resources, a well-educated population, and a diverse, but declining,
industrial base, continues to experience formidable difficulties in
moving from its old centrally planned economy to a modern market
economy. After seven consecutive years of contraction 1990-96 in which
GDP fell by one-third, GDP grew by 0.4% in 1997, according to official
statistics. Moscow continued to make strides in its battle against
inflation, which fell to 11%, half the 1996 rate. The central
government made good on most back wages owed public-sector
employees-including the military-although the stock of wage arrears to
employees of private enterprises remained large. Privatization
revenues increased significantly, largely on the strength of a few
high-profile tenders, such as that of telecommunications giant
Svyazinvest. On the downside, Moscow continued to struggle with a
severe fiscal imbalance. Lagging tax collections led the government to
adopt a revised budget in spring 1997 that cut spending by about 20%
despite protests from the legislature. Russia's traditional trade
surplus continued to contract-largely because of soft international
commodity prices-and Moscow's WTrO accession made only halting
progress. Although President YEL'TSIN brought in a new economic team
early in 1997, key structural reform initiatives continue to move
slowly. A revised tax code remains stuck in the Duma, while little
progress is being made on agricultural land reform. Small business
development has lagged. Prospects for a return to robust growth have
been set back by the spillover from Asia's financial turmoil, which
hit Russia hard during the last quarter of 1997. Moscow at first tried
to both support the ruble and keep interest rates down, but this
policy proved unsustainable, and in early December 1997 the Central
Bank let interest rates rise sharply. As the year ended, Russian
authorities were attempting to put the best face on the financial
situation, while at the same time scaling back their previous
optimistic growth projections for 1998 to 1%-2%. Because of Russia's
severe macroeconomic constraints, resources allocated to the military
sector have declined sharply since the implosion of the USSR in
December 1991.

@Rwanda:Economy

Economy-overview: Rwanda is a poor African nation that has suffered
bitterly from ethnic-based civil war. The agricultural sector
dominates the economy; coffee and tea normally make up 80%-90% of
exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
deforestation and soil erosion continue to reduce the production
potential. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of
agricultural products. A structural adjustment program with the World
Bank began in October 1990. Civil war in 1990 devastated wide areas,
especially in the north, and displaced hundreds of thousands of
people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of the
fighting, but resumption of large-scale violence and genocide in April
1994 in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere took 500,000 lives in
that year alone and severely damaged already poor economic prospects.
In 1994-96, peace was restored throughout much of the country. In
1996-97 most of the refugees who fled the war returned to Rwanda.
Sketchy data suggest that GDP dropped 50% in 1994 and came back
partially, by 25%, in 1995. Plentiful rains helped agriculture in
1996, and outside aid continued to support this desperately poor
economy. The economy continues to face significant challenges in
rehabilitating infrastructure, agriculture, health care facilities,
and capital plant. Recovery of domestic production will proceed
slowly.

@Saint Kitts and Nevis:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy has traditionally depended on the
growing and processing of sugarcane; decreasing world prices have hurt
the industry in recent years. Tourism, export-oriented manufacturing,
and offshore banking activity have assumed larger roles. Most food is
imported. The government has undertaken a program designed to
revitalize the faltering sugar sector. It is also working to improve
revenue collection in order to better fund social programs. In 1997
some leaders in Nevis were urging separation from Saint Kitts on the
basis that Nevis was paying far more in taxes than it was receiving in
government services.

@Saint Lucia:Economy

Economy-overview: Though foreign investment in manufacturing and
information processing in recent years has increased Saint Lucia's
industrial base, the economy remains vulnerable due to its heavy
dependence on banana production, which is subject to periodic droughts
and tropical storms. Indeed, the destructive effect of Tropical Storm
Iris in mid-1995 caused the loss of 20% of the year's banana crop.
Increased competition from Latin American bananas will probably
further reduce market prices, exacerbating Saint Lucia's need to
diversify its economy in coming years, e.g., by further expanding
tourism, manufacturing, and construction.

@Saint Pierre and Miquelon:Economy

Economy-overview: The inhabitants have traditionally earned their
livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off
the coast of Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however,
because the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped
steadily over the years. In 1992, an arbitration panel awarded the
islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a
longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents
only 25% of what France had sought. The islands are heavily subsidized
by France. Imports come primarily from Canada and France.

@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines:Economy

Economy-overview: Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is the
most important sector of this lower middle income economy. The
services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist industry, is also
important. The government has been relatively unsuccessful at
introducing new industries, and high unemployment rates of 35%-40%
continue. The continuing dependence on a single crop represents the
biggest obstacle to the islands' development; tropical storms wiped
out substantial portions of crops in both 1994 and 1995. The tourism
sector has considerable potential for development over the next
decade.

@Samoa:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of Samoa has traditionally been
dependent on development aid, private family remittances from
overseas, and agricultural exports. The country is vulnerable to
devastating storms. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labor force,
and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring coconut cream, coconut oil,
and copra. Outside of a large automotive wire harness factory, the
manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. Tourism
is an expanding sector; more than 70,0000 tourists visited the islands
in 1996. The 1998 Samoan budget calls for deregulation of the
financial sector, development of more financial investments, and
forecasts 3% to 4% growth.

@Sao Tome and Principe:Economy

Economy-overview: This small poor island economy has become
increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence over 20 years ago.
However, cocoa production has substantially declined because of
drought and mismanagement. The resulting shortage of cocoa for export
has created a persistent balance-of-payments problem. Sao Tome has to
import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a
significant amount of food. Over the years, it has been unable to
service its external debt and has had to depend on concessional aid
and debt rescheduling. Considerable potential exists for development
of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand
facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to
reduce price controls and subsidies, but economic growth has remained
sluggish. Sao Tome is also optimistic that significant petroleum
discoveries are forthcoming in its territorial waters in the oil-rich
waters of the Gulf of Guinea.

@Saudi Arabia:Economy

Economy-overview: This is a well-to-do oil-based economy with strong
government controls over major economic activities. About 35% of GDP
comes from the private sector. Economic (as well as political) ties
with the US are especially strong. The petroleum sector accounts for
roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, and 90% of export
earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the
world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest exporter of
petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the
government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit
since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic
activity. Roughly 4 million foreign workers play an important role in
the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and service sectors. Helped
by production above its OPEC quota, Saudi Arabia continued to bring
its finances closer into balance in 1997, recording a $1.6 billion
budget deficit and a $200 million current account surplus. For 1998,
the country looks to its policies of maintaining moderate fiscal
reforms, restraining public spending, and encouraging nonoil exports.
Shortages of water and rapid population growth will constrain
government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural
products.

@Senegal:Economy

Economy-overview: In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold and
ambitious economic reform program with the support of the
international donor community. This reform began with a 50%
devaluation of Senegal's currency, the CFA franc, which is linked at a
fixed rate to the French franc. Government price controls and
subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy
contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround, thanks
to the reform program, with real growth in GDP of 5.6% in 1996 and
4.7% in 1997. Annual inflation has been pushed below 3% and the fiscal
deficit has been cut to less than 1.5% of GDP. Investment has been
steadily rising from 13.8% of GDP in 1993 to 16.5% in 1997. As a
member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA),
Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified
external tariff. Senegal also realized full Internet connectivity in
1996, creating a miniboom in information technology-based services.
Private activity now accounts for 82% of GDP. On the negative side,
Senegal faces deep-seated urban problems of chronic unemployment,
juvenile delinquency, and drug addiction.

@Serbia and Montenegro:Economy

Economy-overview: The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in
1991 has been followed by highly destructive warfare, the
destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup of important
interrepublic trade flows. Output in Serbia and Montenegro dropped by
half in 1992-93. Like the other former Yugoslav republics, it had
depended on its sister republics for large amounts of energy and
manufactures. Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and
levels of technology among the republics accentuated this
interdependence, as did the communist practice of concentrating much
industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The breakup of
many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial plants
lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in
the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the
republics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia is
the continuation in office of a communist government that is primarily
interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform.
Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new currency unit in
June 1993; prices have been relatively stable since 1995. Reliable
statistics continue to be hard to come by, and the GDP estimate is
extremely rough. The economic boom anticipated by the government after
the suspension of UN sanctions in December 1995 has failed to
materialize. Until the government cooperates on such matters as human
rights and war criminals, it will lack full support from international
financial institutions.

@Seychelles:Economy

Economy-overview: Since independence in 1976, per capita output in
this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the
old near-subsistence level. Growth has been led by the tourist sector,
which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70%
of hard currency earnings, and by tuna fishing, which accounted for
70% of GDP in 1996-97. In recent years the government has encouraged
foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At
the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on
tourism by promoting the development of farming, fishing, and
small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of the tourist sector was
illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf war.
Although the industry has rebounded, the government recognizes the
continuing need for upgrading the sector in the face of stiff
international competition.

SIERRA LEONE

Introduction

Current issues: On 25 May 1997, the democratically-elected government
of President Ahmad Tejan KABBAH was overthrown by disgruntled army
personnel under the command of Major Johnny Paul KOROMA; President
KABBAH fled to exile in Guinea. The Economic Community of West African
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) forces, led by a strong
Nigerian contingent, undertook the suppression of the rebellion. They
were initially unsuccessful, but, by October 1997, they forced the
rebels to agree to a cease-fire and to a plan to return the government
to democratic control by 22 April 1998. However, the agreed
demobilization of the combatants was not carried out by the rebel
junta. On 5 February 1998, hostilities broke out in the outskirts of
Freetown and ECOMOG mounted a major offensive, completely routing the
rebels. President KABBAH returned to office on 10 March to face the
task of restoring order to a demoralized population and a disorganized
and severely damaged economy.

@Sierra Leone:Economy

Economy-overview: Sierra Leone has substantial mineral, agricultural,
and fishery resources. However, the economic and social infrastructure
is not well developed, and serious social disorders continue to hamper
economic development. The seizure of power by the new Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council (AFRC) in May 1997 led to UN sanctions and a
sharp drop in GDP. About two-thirds of the working-age population
engages in subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of
the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the
domestic market. Bauxite and rutile mines have been shut down by civil
strife. The major source of hard currency is found in the mining of
diamonds, the large majority of which are smuggled out of the country.

@Singapore:Economy

Economy-overview: Singapore has an open economy with strong service
and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links
derived from its entrepot history. Extraordinarily strong fundamentals
allowed Singapore to weather the effects of the Asian financial crisis
better than its neighbors, but the crisis did pull GDP growth down to
approximately 6% in 1997. Projections for 1998 GDP growth are in the
4.5% to 6.5% range. Rising labor costs and appreciation of the
Singapore dollar against its neighbors' currencies continue to be a
threat to Singapore's competitiveness. The government's strategy to
address this problem includes increasing productivity, improving
infrastructure, and encouraging higher value-added industries. In
applied technology, per capita output, investment, and labor
discipline, Singapore has key attributes of a developed country.

@Slovakia:Economy

Economy-overview: Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic on 1
January 1993, Slovakia has continued the difficult transformation from
a centrally controlled economy to a modern market-oriented economy.
Macroeconomic performance improved steadily in 1994-96, but
privatization progressed only in fits and starts. Strong export
performance boosted GDP growth to 4.9% in 1994 after a four-year
decline. GDP then rose by 6.8% in 1995, 7% in 1996, and 5.9% in 1997,
rates among the highest in Central and Eastern Europe. Inflation
dropped from 26% in 1993 to 6% annually in 1996-97, the lowest rate in
the region. Private activity now makes up more than two-thirds of GDP.
Although Slovak economic performance continues to be impressive, many
warning signs of possible danger ahead have been raised. Aggregate
demand has surged in the form of increased personal and government
consumption. At the same time that the budget deficit is growing, the
money supply has been rapidly increasing, which could apply upward
pressure on inflation. The trade and current account deficits both are
mounting as imports soar and exports sag. Perhaps most troubling,
Slovakia continues to have difficulty attracting foreign investment
because of perceived political problems and halting progress on
restructuring and privatization. Continuing economic recovery in
western Europe should boost exports and production, but Slovakia's
position with foreign creditors and investors could suffer setbacks in
1998 if progress on privatization and restructuring stalls and if
domestic political problems continue to tarnish its international
image.

@Slovenia:Economy

Economy-overview: Today, Slovenia exhibits the highest per capita GDP
of all the transition economies of the region, fairly moderate
inflation, and a comfortable level of international reserves. However,
GDP has posted slower growth since reaching a zenith of 5.5% in 1994.
Growth declined to 3.5% in 1995 and 3.2% in 1996 and in 1997. Exports
in 1997 benefited from economic recovery abroad-especially of
Slovenia's main trading partners of the EU, which take 70% of Slovene
exports. This export-led trend is predicted to continue, with an
expected GDP growth rate of 3.8% for 1998. Slovenia received an
invitation in 1997 to begin accession negotiations with the EU-a
further reflection of Slovenia's sound economic footing. Slovenia must
press on with privatization, enterprise restructuring, institution
reform, and liberalization of financial markets, thereby creating
conditions conducive to foreign investment, and maintaining a stable
tolar.

@Somalia:People

Population: 6,841,695 (July 1998 est.)
note: this estimate was derived from an official census taken in 1987
by the Somali Government with the cooperation of the UN and the US
Bureau of the Census; population estimates are updated year by year
between census years by factoring growth rates into them and by taking
account of refugee movements and of losses due to famine; lower
estimates of Somalia's population in mid-1996 (on the order of 6.0
million to 6.5 million) have been made by aid and relief agencies,
based on the number of persons being fed; population counting in
Somalia is complicated by the large numbers of nomads and by refugee
movements in response to famine and clan warfare

Government-note: While chaos and clan fighting continue in most of
Somalia, some orderly government has been established in the northern
part. In May 1991, the elders of clans in former British Somaliland
established the independent Republic of Somaliland, which, although
not recognized by any government, maintains a stable existence, aided
by the overwhelming dominance of the ruling clan and the economic
infrastructure left behind by British, Russian and American military
assistance programs. The economy has been growing and in February 1996
the EU agreed to finance the reconstruction of the port of Berbera;
since then, other aid projects have been assumed by the EU and by a
non-governmental Italian organization.

@Somalia:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the world's poorest and least developed
countries, Somalia has few resources. Moreover, much of the economy
has been devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most
important sector, with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and
about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and semi-nomads, who are
dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion
of the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and
employs about 20% of the work force. After livestock, bananas are the
principal export; sugar, sorghum, corn, and fish are products for the
domestic market. The small industrial sector, based on the processing
of agricultural products, accounts for less than 10% of GDP; most
facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife. Moreover,
ongoing civil disturbances in Mogadishu and outlying areas are
interfering with any substantial economic advance.

@South Africa:Economy

Economy-overview: South Africa is a middle-income, developing country
with an abundant supply of resources, well developed financial, legal,
communications, energy, and transport sectors, a stock exchange that
ranks among the 10 largest in the world, and a modern infrastructure
supporting an efficient distribution of goods to major urban centers
throughout the region. Growth has been positive since the historic
election of President Nelson MANDELA in the country's first
multi-racial elections in 1994, but not strong enough to cut into the
substantial unemployment. Daunting economic problems remain from the
apartheid era, especially the problems of poverty and economic
empowerment among the blacks. Other problems are crime and corruption.
The new South African Government demonstrated its commitment to open
markets, privatization, and a favorable investment climate with the
release of its macroeconomic strategy in June 1996. Called "Growth,
Employment and Redistribution," this policy framework includes the
introduction of tax incentives to stimulate new investment in
labor-intensive projects, expansion of basic infrastructure services,
the restructuring and partial privatization of state assets, continued
reduction of tariffs and subsidies to promote economic efficiency,
improved services to the disadvantaged, and integration into the
global economy.

@Spain:Economy

Economy-overview: Spain's mixed capitalist economy supports a GDP that
on a per capita basis is three-fourths that of the four leading West
European economies. Its center-right government has staked much on
gaining admission to the first group of countries to implement the
European single currency and, based on economic indicators, Madrid
appears poised to be in EMU from the outset. The deficit-to-GDP ratio
is 2.3%, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be around 68%, and
inflation is approximately 2%. Moreover, the AZNAR administration has
continued to advocate liberalization, privatization, and deregulation
of the economy, and has introduced some tax reforms to that end.
Unemployment, nonetheless, remains the highest in the EU at 21%. The
government, for political reasons, has made only limited progress in
changing labor laws or reforming pension schemes, which are key to the
sustainability of both Spain's internal economic advances and its
competitiveness in a single currency area.

@Sri Lanka:Economy

Economy-overview: At independence in 1948, plantations growing tea,
rubber, or coconuts and paddies growing rice for subsistence dominated
Sri Lanka's economy, and, as late as 1970, plantation crops accounted
for 93% of exports. In 1977, Colombo abandoned statist economic
policies and its import substitution trade policy for market-oriented
policies and export-oriented trade. Sri Lanka's most dynamic
industries now are food processing, textiles and apparel, food and
beverages, telecommunications, and insurance and banking. By 1996
plantation crops made up only 20% of exports, while textiles and
garments accounted for 63%. GDP grew at an annual average rate of 5.5%
throughout the 1990s until a drought and a deteriorating security
situation lowered growth to 3.8% in 1996. The economy rebounded in
second half 1996, however, and continued to perform well in 1997 with
growth of 6%. Sustained economic growth, coupled with population
growth of only 1.1%, has pushed Sri Lanka from the ranks of the
poorest countries in the world up to the threshold of the middle
income countries. For the next round of reforms, the central bank of
Sri Lanka recommends that Colombo expand market mechanisms in
nonplantation agriculture, dismantle the government's monopoly on
wheat imports, and promote more competition in the financial sector. A
continuing cloud over the economy is the fighting between the
Sinhalese and the minority Tamils, which has cost 50,000 lives in the
past 14 years.

from abroad, and counterproductive economic policies. The private
sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with most
private industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture employs 80%
of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.
Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable
largely to declining annual rainfall, has kept per capita income at
low levels. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause
difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took the unusual
step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment of
arrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked on promised reforms in
1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund. To avoid
expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the
Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies, measures it has
partially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the
civil war and its growing international isolation continued to inhibit
growth in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during 1997.
Hyperinflation has raised consumer prices above the reach of most. In
1997, a top priority was to develop potentially lucrative oilfields in
south-central Sudan; the government was seeking foreign partners to
exploit the oil sector.

@Suriname:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry,
which accounts for more than 15% of GDP and 70% of export earnings.
Following a dismal year in 1994-which saw the value of the Surinamese
guilder plummet by about 70%, inflation rise to more than 600%, and
national output fall for the fifth consecutive year-nearly all
economic indicators improved in 1995-97. The VENETIAAN government
unified the exchange rate as part of its structural adjustment program
(SAP). After assuming power in the fall of 1996, the WIJDENBOSCH
government ended the SAP claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements
of society. Tax revenues fell as old taxes lapsed and the government
failed to implement new tax alternatives. By the end of 1997, the
allocation of new Dutch development funds was frozen as Surinamese
government relations with Holland deteriorated. Suriname's economic
prospects for the medium term will depend on renewed commitment to
financially responsible monetary and fiscal policies.

Economy-overview: Coal mining is the major economic activity on
Svalbard. The treaty of 9 February 1920 gives the 41 signatories equal
rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation.
Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the
past, the only companies still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The
settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The Norwegian
state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian
population on the island, runs many of the local services, and
provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some trapping
of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

@Swaziland:Economy

Economy-overview: In this small landlocked economy, subsistence
agriculture occupies more than 60% of the population. Manufacturing
features a number of agroprocessing factories. Mining has declined in
importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted
by 1978, and health concerns have cut world demand for asbestos.
Exports of soft drink concentrate, sugar and wood pulp are the main
earners of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a
short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South
Africa from which it receives nearly 90% of its imports and to which
it sends more than half of its exports. Remittances from Swazi workers
in South African mines supplement domestically earned income by as
much as 20%. The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for
foreign investment. Overgrazing, soil depletion, and drought persist
as problems for the future.

@Sweden:Economy

Economy-overview: Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole
twentieth century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living
under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare
benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and
external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,
hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy
heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account
for about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector
accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for only
2% of GDP and 2% of the jobs. In recent years, however, this
extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by budgetary
difficulties, inflation, high unemployment, and a gradual loss of
competitiveness in international markets. To curb the budget deficit
and bolster confidence in the economy, the government adopted an
adjustment program in November 1994 that aims to eliminate the
government budget deficit and to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio.
Sweden has harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU,
which it joined at the start of 1995. Sweden has decided not to join
the EMU (European Monetary Union). Annual GDP growth should edge up to
2.5% in 1998-99.

@Switzerland:Economy

Economy-overview: Switzerland, a fundamentally prosperous and stable
modern economy with a per capita GDP roughly 10% above that of the big
West European economies, is experiencing continued economic
difficulties. GDP growth was a minus 0.2% in 1996 and a weak plus 0.4%
in 1997. Weak domestic consumer demand is partly at fault; stagnating
real disposable income combines with a reluctance to reduce saving
rates in the face of an uncertain employment outlook. Switzerland's
leading sectors, including financial services, biotechnology,
pharmaceuticals, and special-purpose machines, therefore are more
reliant on export markets. Exports should lead an upturn in Swiss
economic performance in 1998-99, provided the franc does not
appreciate substantially as a result of Swiss monetary policy or
instability in the run up to EMU.

@Syria:Economy

Economy-overview: Syria's predominantly statist economy is on a shaky
footing because of Damascus's failure to implement extensive economic
reform. The dominant agricultural sector remains underdeveloped, with
roughly 80% of agricultural land still dependent on rain-fed sources.
Although Syria has sufficient water supplies in the aggregate at
normal levels of precipitation, the great distance between major water
supplies and population centers poses serious distribution problems.
The water problem is exacerbated by rapid population growth,
industrial expansion, and increased water pollution. Private
investment is critical to the modernization of the agricultural,
energy, and export sectors. Oil production is leveling off, and the
efforts of the nonoil sector to penetrate international markets have
fallen short. Syria's inadequate infrastructure, outmoded
technological base, and weak educational system make it vulnerable to
future shocks and hamper competition with neighbors such as Jordan and
Israel.

@Taiwan:Economy

Economy-overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with
gradually decreasing guidance of investment and foreign trade by
government authorities and partial government ownership of some large
banks and industrial firms. Spillover from the Asian financial crisis
hit Taiwan in the fourth quarter of 1997, wreaking havoc on the stock
and currency markets. While the economy remains sound (the government
forecasts 6% GDP growth for 1998), the New Taiwan Dollar depreciated
20% in 1997. Real growth in GDP has averaged about 8.5% a year during
the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster and has
provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation and unemployment
are low. Agriculture contributes only 3% to GDP, down from 35% in
1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being moved
off-shore and replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive
industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of
labor markets has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and
illegal.

@Tajikistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Tajikistan has the lowest per capita GDP among the
former Soviet republics. Agriculture dominates the economy, with
cotton the most important crop. Mineral resources, varied but limited
in amount, include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry is
limited to a large aluminum plant, hydropower facilities, and small
obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing. The
Tajik economy has been gravely weakened by four years of civil
conflict and by the loss of subsidies from Moscow and of markets for
its products. Tajikistan thus depends on aid from Russia and
Uzbekistan and on international humanitarian assistance for much of
its basic subsistence needs. Even if the peace agreement of June 1997
is honored, the country faces major problems in integrating refugees
and former combatants into the economy. Moreover, constant political
turmoil and the continued dominance by former communist officials have
impeded the introduction of meaningful economic reforms.

@Tanzania:Economy

Economy-overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the
world. The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts
for 57% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work
force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated
crops to only 4% of the land area. Industry accounts for 17% of GDP
and is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light
consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in mid-1986
has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided
funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.
Growth in 1991-97 has featured a pickup in industrial production and a
substantial increase in output of minerals, led by gold. Natural gas
exploration in the Rufiji Delta looks promising and production could
start by 2002. Recent banking reforms have helped increase private
sector growth and investment.

@Thailand:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997/98, the Thai economy is in a deep recession
as a result of the severe financial problems facing many Thai firms,
particularly banks and finance companies. In the early 1990s, Thailand
liberalized financial inflows; banks and other firms borrowed in
dollars and did not hedge their positions because there was no
perceived exchange rate risk. These funds financed a property boom
that began to taper off in the mid-1990s. In addition, export growth -
previously a key driver of the Thai economy-collapsed in 1996,
resulting in growing doubts that the Bank of Thailand could maintain
the baht's peg to the dollar. The Bank mounted an expensive defense of
the exchange rate that nearly depleted foreign exchange reserves, then
decided to float the exchange rate, triggering a sharp increase in
foreign liabilities that cash-strapped Thai firms were already having
trouble repaying. In August 1997, the government headed by Prime
Minister CHAWALIT signed an agreement with the IMF for access to a $14
billion facility to supplement foreign exchange reserves and restore
financial market stability. CHAWALIT resigned in November 1997,
however, under pressure for lacking a coherent approach to managing
the IMF program and the financial crisis. Democratic Party leader
CHUAN Likphai formed a seven-party coalition government and closely
adhered to the IMF program, tentatively reestablishing financial
stability by February 1998. An economic turnaround requires
rescheduling the large short-term foreign liabilities of Thai firms,
restoring high rates of export growth to finance foreign liabilities,
and extensively recapitalizing the banking system.

@Togo:Economy

Economy-overview: This small sub-Saharan economy is heavily dependent
on both commercial and subsistence agriculture, which provides
employment for more than 60% of the labor force. Cocoa, coffee, and
cotton together generate about 30% of export earnings. Togo is
self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal, with
occasional regional supply difficulties. In the industrial sector,
phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, although it
has suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices and increased
foreign competition. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade
center. The government's decade-long effort, supported by the World
Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures, encourage
foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures has
stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes
throughout 1992 and 1993, has jeopardized the reform program, shrunk
the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity. The 12 January
1994 devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus
to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by
the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. The
1998 presidential elections provide an important opportunity for
Togo's evolving political system to demonstrate that the country can
participate in a peaceful and effective manner with World Bank and IMF
programs. Progress depends on continuing privatization, increased
transparency in government accounting to accommodate increased social
service outlays, and possible downsizing of the military, on which the
regime has depended to stay in place.

Economy-overview: Tokelau's small size, isolation, and lack of
resources greatly restrain economic development and confine
agriculture to the subsistence level. The people must rely on aid from
New Zealand to maintain public services, annual aid being
substantially greater than GDP. The principal sources of revenue come
from sales of copra, postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts.
Money is also remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand.

@Tonga:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy's base is agriculture, which contributes
32% to GDP. Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans are the main
crops, and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of total exports.
The country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New
Zealand. The industrial sector accounts for only 10% of GDP. Tourism
is the primary source of hard currency earnings; the country also
remains dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to offset
its trade deficit. The economy grew at a declining rate in 1993-96.
The government has been turning its attention to further development
of the private sector and the reduction of the budget deficit.

@Trinidad and Tobago:Economy

Economy-overview: Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an
excellent investment site for international businesses. Successful
economic reforms were implemented in 1995, and foreign investment and
trade are flourishing. Unemployment - a main cause of the country's
socio-economic problems-is high, but has decreased to its lowest point
in five years. The country enjoys a healthy trade surplus, yet its
heavy dependence on oil and petrochemical prices makes its trade
balance vulnerable to sudden shifts. Tourism is a major foreign
exchange earner, with 260,000 arrivals in 1995, 80% from Europe.

@Tunisia:Economy

Economy-overview: Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important
agricultural, mining, energy, tourism, and manufacturing sectors.
Governmental control of economic affairs has gradually lessened over
the past decade with increasing privatization of trade and commerce,
simplification of the tax structure, and a prudent approach to debt.
Real growth averaged 4.6% in 1992-96 and reached 5.6% in 1997, down
from 6.9% in 1996, which benefited from a record cereal crop.
Inflation has been moderate. Growth in tourism and increased trade
have been key elements in this solid record. Tunisia's association
agreement with the European Union entered into force on 1 March 1998,
the first such accord between the EU and Mediterranean countries to be
activated. Under the agreement Tunisia will gradually remove barriers
to trade with the EU over the next decade. Further privatization, the
attraction of increased foreign investment, and improvements in
government efficiency are among the challenges for the future.

@Turkey:Economy

Economy-overview: Turkey's dynamic economy is a complex mix of modern
industry and commerce along with traditional village agriculture and
crafts. It has a strong and rapidly growing private sector, yet the
state still plays a major role in basic industry, banking, transport,
and communication. Its most important industry-and the largest source
of exports-is textiles and clothing, which is almost entirely in
private hands. The current economic situation is marked by strong
growth coupled with serious imbalances. Real GDP expanded by about 7%
in 1997 but inflation rose to 99% at yearend, and the public sector
fiscal deficit probably remained near 10% of GDP. To some extent,
Ankara is caught in a vicious fiscal circle because about half of all
central government revenue is going to pay interest on the national
debt. The government that took office in July 1997-headed by Prime
Minister YILMAZ's Motherland Party-enacted a 1998 budget that includes
substantial tax increases and cuts in non-interest spending but these
gains will be offset by a jump in interest payments. The government
also is planning to overhaul the social welfare and tax systems and to
speed up privatization, although these reforms will face tough
political opposition. Ankara is trying to increase trade with other
countries in the region but most of Turkey's trade is still with OECD
countries. Despite the implementation in January 1996 of customs union
with the EU, foreign direct investment in the country remains
low-about $0.5 billion annually-perhaps because potential investors
are concerned about high inflation and the unsettled political
situation. Economic growth will slow in 1998 to perhaps 4%, and
inflation should decline, although the government's 50% target appears
overoptimistic. The current account deficit probably will remain
small-1% to 1.5% of GDP - when Turkey's unrecorded "suitcase" exports

@Turkmenistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic
cattle raising, intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas
and oil resources. One-half of its irrigated land is planted in
cotton, making it the world's tenth largest producer. It also
possesses the world's fifth largest reserves of natural gas and
substantial oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had
experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states
because its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and
gas and a sharp increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's
refusal to export Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and mounting
debts of its major customers in the former USSR for gas deliveries
contributed to a sharp fall in industrial production and caused the
budget to shift from a surplus to a slight deficit. The economy
bottomed out in 1996, but high inflation continued. Furthermore, with
an authoritarian ex-communist regime in power and a tribally based
social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to
economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its
inefficient economy. In 1996, the government set in place a
stabilization program aimed at a unified and market-based exchange
rate, allocation of government credits by auction, and strict limits
on budget deficits. Privatization goals remain limited. Turkmenistan
is working hard to open new gas export channels through Iran and
Turkey to Europe, but these will take many years to realize.

TUVALU

@Tuvalu:Geography

Location: Oceania, island group consisting of nine coral atolls in the
South Pacific Ocean, about one-half of the way from Hawaii to
Australia

Geographic coordinates: 8 00 S, 178 00 E

Map references: Oceania

Area:
total: 26 sq km
land: 26 sq km
water: 0 sq km

Area-comparative: 0.1 times the size of Washington, DC

Land boundaries: 0 km

Coastline: 24 km

Maritime claims:
contiguous zone: 24 nm
exclusive economic zone: 200 nm
territorial sea: 12 nm

Climate: tropical; moderated by easterly trade winds (March to
November); westerly gales and heavy rain (November to March)

Terrain: very low-lying and narrow coral atolls

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m
highest point: unnamed location 5 m

Natural resources: fish

Land use:
arable land: 0%
permanent crops: 0%
permanent pastures: 0%
forests and woodland: 0%
other: 100% (1993 est.)
note: Tuvalu's nine coral atolls have enough soil to grow coconuts and
support subsistence agriculture

Irrigated land: NA sq km

Natural hazards: severe tropical storms are usually rare, but, in
1997, there were three cyclones

Environment-current issues: since there are no streams or rivers and
groundwater is not potable, all water needs must be met by catchment
systems with storage facilities; beachhead erosion because of the use
of sand for building materials; excessive clearance of forest
undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral reefs from the spread of
the Crown of Thorns starfish; Tuvalu is very concerned about global
increases in greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on rising sea
levels, which threaten the country's underground water table

@Tuvalu:Economy

Economy-overview: Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered
group of nine coral atolls with poor soil. The country has no known
mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence farming and fishing are
the primary economic activities. The islands are too small and too
remote for development of a large-scale tourist industry. Government
revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
remittances. About 1,000 Tuvaluans work in Nauru in the phosphate
mining industry. Nauru has begun repatriating Tuvaluans, however, as
phosphate resources decline, which will present additional problems
for Tuvalu's already stretched economy. Substantial income is received
annually from an international trust fund established in 1987 by
Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea.
In an effort to reduce its dependence on foreign aid, the government
is pursuing public sector reforms, including privatization of some
government functions and personnel cuts of up to 7%. Low-lying Tuvalu
is particularly vulnerable to any future global warming.

@Uganda:Economy

Economy-overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources, including
fertile soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of
copper and cobalt. Agriculture is the most important sector of the
economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major
export crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986,
the government-with the support of foreign countries and international
agencies-has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by
undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops,
increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service
wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation
and boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-97, the economy
turned in a solid performance based on: continued investment in the
rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production
and exports, reduced inflation, gradually improved domestic security,
and the return of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs.

@Ukraine:Economy

Economy-overview: After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and
away the most important economic component of the former Soviet Union,
producing about four times the output of the next-ranking republic.
Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet
agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities of
meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its
diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials to
industrial and mining sites in other regions of the former USSR.
Ukraine depends on imports of energy, especially natural gas. Shortly
after the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, the Ukrainian
Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for
privatization, but widespread resistance to reform within the
government and the legislature soon stalled reform efforts and led to
some backtracking. Output in 1992-97 fell to less than half the 1991
level. Loose monetary policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary
levels in late 1993. Since his election in July 1994, President KUCHMA
has pushed economic reforms, maintained financial discipline, and
tried to remove almost all remaining controls over prices and foreign
trade. Implementation of KUCHMA's economic agenda is encountering
considerable resistance from parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and
industrial interests; and an environment of corruption continues to
discourage foreign investors. One signal achievement has been the
reduction of the inflation rate to 10% by yearend 1997. If KUCHMA
succeeds in implementing aggressive market reforms during 1998, the
economy should reverse its downward trend, with real growth occurring
by late 1998 and into 1999.

@United Arab Emirates:Economy

Economy-overview: The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's
highest per capita incomes and with a sizable annual trade surplus.
Its wealth is based on oil and gas output (about 33% of GDP), and the
fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of those
commodities. Since 1973, the UAE has undergone a profound
transformation from an impoverished region of small desert
principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. At
present levels of production, oil and gas reserves should last for
over 100 years. The UAE Government is encouraging increased
privatization within the economy, and industrial development is
expected to pick up in 1997-98.

Kuchek in Persian by Iran) and Greater Tunb (called Tunb al Kubra in
Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Tonb-e Bozorg in Persian by Iran); claims
island in the Persian Gulf jointly administered with Iran (called Abu
Musa in Arabic by UAE and Jazireh-ye Abu Musa in Persian by Iran)-over
which Iran has taken steps to exert unilateral control since 1992,
including access restrictions and a military build-up on the island;
the UAE has garnered significant diplomatic support in the region in

@United Kingdom:Economy

Economy-overview: The UK is one of the world's great trading powers
and financial centers, and its essentially capitalistic economy ranks
among the four largest in Western Europe. Over the past two decades
the government has greatly reduced public ownership and contained the
growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly
mechanized, and efficient by European standards, producing about 60%
of food needs with only about 1% of the labor force. The UK has large
coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy production
accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any industrial
nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and business
services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while
industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only 18% of
the work force. Exports and manufacturing output have been the primary
engines of growth. Unemployment is gradually falling. Inflation is a
moderate 3.1%. A major economic policy question for the UK in the late
1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and
economic integration of Europe.

@United States:Economy

Economy-overview: The US has the most powerful, diverse, and
technologically advanced economy in the world, with a per capita GDP
of $30,200, the largest among major industrial nations. In this
market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms make
most of the decisions, and government buys needed goods and services
predominantly in the private marketplace. US business firms enjoy
considerably greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western
Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, lay off surplus
workers, and develop new products. At the same time, they face higher
barriers to entry in their rivals' home markets than the barriers to
entry of foreign firms in US markets. In all economic sectors, US
firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances,
especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military
equipment, although their advantage has narrowed since the end of
World War II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual
development of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the bottom
lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those at
the top and, more and more, fail to get pay raises, health insurance
coverage, and other benefits. The years 1994-97 witnessed moderate
gains in real output, low inflation rates, and a drop in unemployment
below 6%. Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic
infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population,
sizable trade deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower
economic groups. The outlook for 1998 is for continued moderate
growth, low inflation, and about the same level of unemployment. Two
shadows for 1998 are the severe financial crises in East Asia and the
exuberant level of stock prices in relation to corporate earnings.

@Uruguay:Economy

Economy-overview: Uruguay's small economy benefits from a favorable
climate for agriculture and substantial hydropower potential. Economic
development has been restrained in recent years by high-though
declining-inflation and extensive government regulation. The
SANGUINETTI government's conservative monetary and fiscal policies are
aimed at continuing to reduce inflation; other priorities include
extensive reform of the social security system and increased
investment in education. Economic performance remains sensitive to
conditions in Argentina and Brazil, largely because more than half of
Uruguay's trade is conducted with its partners in Mercosur (the
Southern Cone Common Market).

@Uzbekistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 10%
consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It was one
of the poorest areas of the former Soviet Union with more than 60% of
its population living in densely populated rural communities.
Uzbekistan is now the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major
producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally significant
producer of chemicals and machinery. Following independence in
December 1991, the government sought to prop up its Soviet-style
command economy with subsidies and tight controls on production and
prices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however, the government
began to reform in mid-1994, by introducing tighter monetary policies,
expanding privatization, slightly reducing the role of the state in
the economy, and improving the environment for foreign investors.
Nevertheless, the state continues to be a dominating influence in the
economy, and reforms have so far failed to bring about much-needed
structural changes. The IMF suspended Uzbekistan's $185 million
standby arrangement in late 1996 because of governmental steps that
made impossible fulfillment of Fund conditions.

@Vanuatu:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based primarily on subsistence or
small-scale agriculture which provides a living for 65% of the
population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with
46,000 visitors in 1996, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral
deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits.
A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues
come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by
dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to
natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between
constituent islands.

@Venezuela:Economy

Economy-overview: The petroleum sector dominates the economy,
accounting for 27% of GDP, 78% of export earnings, and more than half
of government operating revenues. It is likely to become even more
important as the state petroleum company plans to double its
production over the next 10 years. Realizing the failure of
interventionist policies, the CALDERA administration embarked on a
comprehensive economic reform program, which included negotiation of a
stand-by agreement with the IMF in 1996, elimination of price and
exchange controls, and revitalization of Venezuela's stalled
privatization program. The influx of foreign capital, and the currency
depreciation that followed exchange liberalization, led to 103%
inflation in 1996, the highest in Venezuelan history. The government
stepped in toward the end of 1996, propping up the Bolivar by using a
stable nominal exchange rate as a restraint on inflation-which fell in
1997 to 38%. The macroeconomic adjustments, bolstered by strong oil
prices, resulted in strong growth in 1997. However, the East Asian
financial crisis and the decline of international oil prices toward
the end of 1997 brought pressure on the currency, which Caracas was
able to stave off. Caracas readjusted its exchange rate bands and
began to allow quicker depreciation of the Bolivar; the government
also tightened monetary policy. Concerned over potential revenue
shortfalls from soft oil prices for the 1998 budget, Caracas has
implemented budget cuts to compensate for previously optimistic oil
revenue estimates. The government also has pushed ahead with sale of
the state-owned steel company and the strategic aluminum sector,
thereby reassuring domestic and international investors of Venezuela's
commitment to reform. The monetary and fiscal measures have been well
received by the international financial community. As a result,
financial analysts believe the economy will still grow at a healthy
pace in 1998, though they have lowered their initial projections for
GDP growth due to the soft oil market.

planned economy. Substantial progress has been achieved over the past
10 years in moving forward from an extremely low starting point.
Economic growth continued at a strong pace during 1997 with industrial
output rising by 12% and real GDP expanding by 8.5%. These positive
numbers, however, masked some major difficulties that are emerging in
economic performance. Many domestic industries, including coal,
cement, steel, and paper, reported large stockpiles of inventory and
tough competition from more efficient foreign producers, giving
Vietnam a trade deficit of $3.3 billion in 1997. While disbursements
of aid and foreign direct investment have risen, they are not large
enough to finance the rapid increase in imports; and it is widely
believed that Vietnam may be using short-term trade credits to bridge
the gap-a risky strategy that could result in a foreign exchange
crunch. Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities continue to move slowly
toward implementing the structural reforms needed to revitalize the
economy and produce more competitive, export-driven industries.
Privatization of state enterprises remains bogged down in political
controversy, while the country's dynamic private sector is denied both
financing and access to markets. Reform of the banking sector is
proceeding slowly, raising concerns that the country will be unable to
tap sufficient domestic savings to maintain current high levels of
growth. Administrative and legal barriers are also causing costly
delays for foreign investors and are raising similar doubts about
Vietnam's ability to maintain the inflow of foreign capital.
Ideological bias in favor of state intervention and control of the
economy is slowing progress toward a more liberalized investment
environment.

@Virgin Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism is the primary economic activity, accounting
for more than 70% of GDP and 70% of employment. The islands normally
host 2 million visitors a year. The number of US tourists in the first
five months of 1996 was down by 55% from the same period in 1995, the
lingering result of the fierce hurricanes of 1995. Unemployment rose
sharply in 1996. The manufacturing sector consists of textile,
electronics, pharmaceutical, and watch assembly plants. The
agricultural sector is small, most food being imported. International
business and financial services are a small but growing component of
the economy. One of the world's largest petroleum refineries is at
Saint Croix. A major economic problem at the beginning of 1997 was the
more than $1 billion in governmental arrears, in income tax refunds,
payments to vendors, and overdue wages.

@Wallis and Futuna:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is limited to traditional subsistence
agriculture, with about 80% of the labor force earning its livelihood
from agriculture (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs),
and fishing. About 4% of the population is employed in government.
Revenues come from French Government subsidies, licensing of fishing
rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from
expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and Futuna imports food -
particularly flour, sugar, rice, and beef-fuel, clothing, machinery,
and transport equipment, but its exports are negligible, consisting
mostly of breadfruit, yams, and taro root.

WEST BANK

Introduction

Current issues: The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13
September 1993, provides for a transitional period not exceeding five
years of Palestinian interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Permanent status negotiations began on 5 May 1996, but have
not resumed since the initial meeting. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to
transfer certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian
Authority, which includes a Palestinian Legislative Council elected in
January 1996, as part of interim self-governing arrangements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities
for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4
May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in
additional areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28
September 1995 Interim Agreement and the Israel-PLO 15 January 1997
Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron. The DOP provides that
Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for
external security and for internal security and public order of
settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to be determined through
direct negotiations.

@West Bank:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered
by tight Israeli security restrictions. Industries using advanced
technology or requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a
lack of local capital and Israeli policies that block the movement of
goods and people. Capital investment consists largely of residential
housing, not productive assets that would enable local Palestinian
firms to compete with Israeli industry. GDP has been substantially
supplemented by workers who commute to jobs in Israel. Worker
remittances from the Persian Gulf states dropped after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, many
Palestinians have returned to the West Bank, increasing unemployment,
and export revenues have dropped because of the decline of markets in
Jordan and the Gulf states. An estimated 147,000 people were in
refugee camps in 1996.

between Morocco and Mauritania in April 1976, with Morocco acquiring
northern two-thirds; Mauritania, under pressure from Polisario
guerrillas, abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979;
Morocco moved to occupy that sector shortly thereafter and has since
asserted administrative control; the Polisario's government-in-exile
was seated as an OAU member in 1984; guerrilla activities continued
sporadically, until a UN-monitored cease-fire was implemented 6
September 1991

@World:Economy

Economy-overview: Real global output-gross world product (GWP)-rose an
estimated 4.0% in 1997. And, once more, results varied widely among
regions and countries. With its solid 3.8% growth, the US again
accounted for 21% of GWP in 1997. Western Europe grew at 2.5%, not
enough to cut into its high unemployment, and accounted for another
21% of GWP. Japan's faltering economy grew at only 0.9% with its share
of GWP at 8%. The advanced countries as a whole accounted for an
estimated 53% of GWP, with overall growth at 3.0%. The 15 former
Soviet republics and the countries of Eastern Europe posted growth of
1.8%, reversing the long downturn that followed the collapse of
communism. Growth varied widely among these countries, e.g., Ukraine
at a negative 3.2%, Russia at a positive 0.4%, and the Baltic
countries at a strong 7%. The area as a whole accounted for 5% of
global output. China and India, with a combined population of 2.2
billion or 37% of the world total, grew at 8.8% and 5%, respectively.
(China's official GDP statistics probably are overstated.) The
developing countries as a whole contributed 42% to GWP with an overall
growth rate of 5.7%. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing
control over resources as separatist regional movements-typically
based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of
the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in India, and in
Canada. In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political
problem of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The
addition of more than 80 million people each year to an already
overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution,
desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of
their own internal problems, the industrialized countries have
inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the
world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming
further marginalized. Toward the end of 1997 and on into 1998, serious
financial difficulties in several high-growth East Asia countries cast
a shadow over short-term global economic prospects. The introduction
of the euro as the common currency of much of Western Europe in
January 1999 will pose serious economic risks because of varying
levels of income and cultural and political differences among the
participating nations. (For specific economic developments in each
country of the world in 1997, see the individual country entries.)

@Yemen:Economy

Economy-overview: The northern city Sanaa is the political capital of
a united Yemen, and the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port
facilities, is the economic and commercial capital. Future economic
development depends heavily on the attraction of foreign investment to
diversify the economy. Former South Yemen's willingness to merge
stemmed partly from the sharp decline in Soviet economic support. The
low level of domestic industry and agriculture has made northern Yemen
dependent on imports for practically all of its essential needs. Once
self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has become a major
importer. Land once used for export crops-cotton, fruit, and
vegetables - has been turned over to growing a shrub called qat, whose
leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect by Yemenis and which has
no significant export market. Economic growth in former South Yemen
has been constrained by a lack of incentives, partly stemming from
centralized control over production decisions, investment allocation,
and import choices. Yemen's GDP has been supplemented by remittances
from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign aid. Since the Gulf crisis,
however, remittances have dropped substantially. Floods in June 1996
caused the loss of much valuable topsoil in the agricultural sector,
increasing the need for imports of foodstuffs. Oil production and GDP
as a whole are expected to increase moderately in 1998.

@Zambia:Economy

Economy-overview: Despite progress in privatization and budgetary
reform, Zambia's economy has a long way to go. Inflation, while
slowing somewhat, continues to be a major concern to the CHILUBA
government. Zambia's copper mining sector, which accounts for over 80%
of the nation's foreign currency intake, is struggling. Production
rates are down as are world copper prices. Aid cuts by Zambia's
donors, arising out of concern for the November 1996 flawed election,
will severely damage Zambia's economic prospects. Urged by the World
Bank, Zambia has embarked on a privatization program which is to
include the all-important copper industry.

@Zimbabwe:Economy

Economy-overview: Agriculture employs 27% of the labor force of this
landlocked nation and supplies almost 25% of exports. Mining accounts
for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but minerals and metals
account for about 20% of exports. The government is working to
consolidate earlier progress in developing a market-oriented economy.
Although the IMF suspended support for Zimbabwe's economic structural
adjustment program (ESAP) in 1995, due to government failure to meet
key targets, recent talks between the government and the Fund have
held hope for renewed support if Zimbabwe remains committed to
budgetary targets. A key element of the budget is the Zimbabwe Program
for Socio-Economic Transformation (ZIMPREST), the second phase of
ESAP, whose goals include increased commercialization and
privatization of government-owned enterprises and more
"outward-looking" trade and investment policies. The World Bank
resumed balance of payments support to Zimbabwe in early 1998.

@NOTES AND DEFINITIONS

There have been some significant changes in this edition. The country
name Western Samoa has been changed to Samoa. The spelling of
Kazakhstan includes the letter "h" once again; the spelling Kazakstan
is no longer used. Introduction is a category with two entries-Current
issues and Historical perspective-that appears in only a few country
profiles at this time. In the future, this category may be added to
more countries.

Abbreviations: This information is included in Appendix A:
Abbreviations, which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in
the Factbook, with their expansions.

Administrative divisions: This entry generally gives the numbers,
designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have
been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.

Age structure: This entry provides the distribution of the population
according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14
years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a
population will affect a country's investment pattern. Countries with
young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more
in schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage
ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age
structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.
For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to
find employment can lead to unrest.

Agriculture-products: This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and
products starting with the most important.

Airports: This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s)
may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt,
sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have
facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.

Airports-with paved runways: This entry gives the total number of
airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For
airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is
included according to the following five groups-(1) over 3,047 m, (2)
2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)
under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control.

Airports-with unpaved runways: This entry gives the total number of
airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces).
For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is
included according to the following five groups-(1) over 3,047 m, (2)
2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)
under 914 m. Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control.

Appendixes: This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.

Area: This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of
all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water
bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,
including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).

Area-comparative: This entry provides an area comparison based on
total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US
or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)
provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are
compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in
Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Birth rate: This entry gives the average annual number of births
during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude
birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in
determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the
level of fertility and the age structure of the population.

Budget: This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital
expenditures.

Climate: This entry includes a brief description of typical weather
regimes throughout the year.

Coastline: This entry gives the total length of the boundary between
the land area (including islands) and the sea.

Communications: This category deals with the means of exchanging
information and includes the radio, telephone, and television entries.

Communications-note: This entry includes miscellaneous communications
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Constitution: This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,
and major amendments.

Country map: Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in
color. The maps were produced from the best information available at
the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed
subsequently.

Country name: This entry includes all forms of the country's name
approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an
example): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional
short form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short
form (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation.
Also see the Terminology note.

Currency: This entry identifies the national medium of exchange and
its basic subunit.

Current issues: This entry at the beginning of a country profile
briefly characterizes major geographic, social, political, and
military developments in the past 12 months and may include a
statement about one or two key future trends. This entry appears for
only a few countries at the present time, but may be added to more
countries in the future.

Data code: This entry gives the official US Government digraph that
precisely identifies every land entity without overlap, duplication,
or omission. AF, for example, is the data code for Afghanistan. This
two-letter country code is a standardized geopolitical data element
promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards
Publication (FIPS) 10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the
Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of
State. The data code is used to eliminate confusion and
incompatibility in the collection, processing, and dissemination of
area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging data
between databases. Appendix F cross-references various country codes
and Appendix G does the same thing for hydrographic codes.

Data codes-country: This information is presented in Appendix F:
Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes which includes the US
Government approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
codes, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) codes,
and Internet codes for land entities.

Data codes-hydrographic: This information is presented in Appendix G:
Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes which includes the
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) codes, Aeronautical
Chart and Information Center (ACIC; now National Imagery and Mapping
Agency or NIMA) codes, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) codes for
hydrographic entities. The US Government has not yet approved a
standard for hydrographic data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard
for country data codes.

Dates of information: The information cutoff date was 1 January 1998,
although a few important changes after that date have been included.
Most demographic statistics are estimates for 1998.

Death rate: This entry gives the average annual number of deaths
during a year per l,000 population at midyear; also known as crude
death rate. The death rate, while only a rough indicator of the
mortality situation in a country, accurately indicates the current
mortality impact on population growth. This indicator is significantly
affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show
a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in
mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging
population.

Debt-external: This entry gives the total amount of public foreign
financial obligations.

Dependency status: This entry describes the formal relationship
between a particular nonindependent entity and an independent state.

Dependent areas: This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all
nonindependent entities associated in some way with a particular
independent state.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 184 independent states, including 178 of the 185 UN members
(excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former
Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic
relations with 6 independent states that are not in the UN-Holy See,
Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.

Diplomatic representation from the US: This entry includes the chief
of mission, embassy address, mailing address, telephone number, FAX
number, branch office locations, consulate general locations, and
consulate locations.

Diplomatic representation in the US: This entry includes the chief of
the foreign mission, chancery address, telephone number, FAX number,
consulate general locations, consulate locations, honorary consulate
general locations, and honorary consulate locations.

Disputes-international: This entry includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding
disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such
as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues;
however, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official
development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is
defined as financial assistance, which is concessional in character,
has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of
LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions
are also official government assistance, but with a main objective
other than economic development and with a grant element less than
25%. OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im
Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt
reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional
terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are
initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration
of intent. The entry is separated into two components-donor and
recipient.

Economy: This category includes the entries dealing with the size,
development, and management of productive resources, i.e., land,
labor, and capital.

Economy-overview: This entry briefly describes the type of economy,
including the degree of market orientation, the level of economic
development, the most important natural resources, and the unique
areas of specialization. It also characterizes major economic events
and policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a
statement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.

Electricity-capacity: This entry gives the maximum designed potential
for electricity production expressed in kilowatts.

Electricity-consumption per capita: This entry gives the figure for
annual electricity generation plus imports, minus exports, and divided
by total population for the same year expressed in kilowatt hours.

Electricity-production: This entry gives the annual amount of
electricity actually generated expressed in kilowatt hours.

Elevation extremes: This entry includes both the highest point and the
lowest point.

Entities: Some of the independent states, dependencies, areas of
special sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are
not independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Independent state" refers to a people politically
organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
"Dependencies" and "areas of special sovereignty" refer to a broad
category of political entities that are associated in some way with an
independent state. "Country" names used in the table of contents or
for page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the
US Board on Geographic Names and may include independent states,
dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty, or other geographic
entities. There are a total of 266 separate geographic entities in The
World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Environment-current issues: This entry lists the most pressing and
important environmental problems.

Environment-international agreements: This entry separates country
participation in international environmental agreements into two
levels-party to and signed but not ratified. Agreements are listed in
alphabetical order by the abbreviated form of the full name.

Environmental agreements: This information is presented in Appendix D:
Selected International Environmental Agreements, which includes the
name, abbreviation, date opened for signature, date entered into
force, objective, and parties by category.

Ethnic groups: This entry provides a rank ordering of ethnic groups
starting with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total
population.

Exchange rates: This entry provides the official value of a country's
monetary unit at a given date or over a given period of time, as
expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and as determined
by international market forces or official fiat.

Executive branch: This entry includes several subfields. Chief of
state includes the name and title of the titular leader of the country
who represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but may
not be involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. Head
of government includes the name and title of the administrative leader
who is designated to manage the day-to-day activities of the
government. Cabinet includes the official name for this body of
advisers and the method for selection of members. Elections includes
the nature of election process or accession to power, date of the last
election, and date of the next election. Election results includes the
percent of vote for each candidate in the last election. In the UK,
the monarch is the chief of state, and the prime minister is the head
of government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and
the head of government.

Exports: This entry includes three subfields. Total value is the total
US dollar amount of exports on an f.o.b. basis. Commodities is a rank
ordering of exported products starting with the most important and
sometimes includes the percent of dollar value. Partners is a rank
ordering of trading partners starting with the most important and
sometimes includes the percent of dollar value.

Fiscal year: This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for
a country's accounting period of 12 months, which often is the
calendar year but may begin in any month. FY93/94 refers to the fiscal
year that began in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994.
All yearly references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated
as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).

Flag description: This entry provides a written flag description
produced from actual flags or the best information available at the
time the entry was written. The flags of independent states are used
by their dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local
flag. Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.

Flag graphic: Most versions of the Factbook include a color flag at
the beginning of the country profile. The flag graphics were produced
from actual flags or the best information available at the time of
preparation. The flags of independent states are used by their
dependencies unless there is an officially recognized local flag. Some
disputed and other areas do not have flags.

GDP: This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all
final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP
dollar estimates in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power
parity (PPP) calculations. See the note on GDP methodology for more
information.

GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all
countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations
rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The
PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price
weights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and
services produced in a given economy. The data derived from the PPP
method provide a better comparison of economic well-being between
countries. The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the
corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate.
When converted at PPP rates, $1,000 will buy the same market basket of
goods in any country. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are
quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough
approximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation
of PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program
(UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the
University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In contrast, currency
exchange rates depend on a variety of international and domestic
financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output.
In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate
estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP
estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by
10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real
output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14
countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are
tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,
of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One
important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a
percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially
from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,
for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of
Russian or Japanese military expenditures.
Note: the numbers for GDP and other economic data can not be chained
together from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes in
the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical
agencies, use of new or different sources of information, and changes
in national statistical methods and practices. For statistical series
on GDP and other economic variables, see the Handbook of International
Economic Statistics available from the same sources as The World
Factbook.

GDP-composition by sector: This entry gives the percentage
contribution of agriculture, industry, and services to total GDP.

GDP-per capita: This entry shows GDP on a purchasing power parity
basis divided by population as of 1 July for the same year.

GDP-real growth rate: This entry gives GDP growth on an annual basis
adjusted for inflation and expressed as a percent.

Geographic coordinates: This entry includes rounded latitude and
longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate
geographic center of an entity and is based on the Gazetteer of
Conventional Names, Third Edition, August 1988, US Board on Geographic
Names and on other sources.

Geographic names: This information is presented in Appendix H:
Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names which indicates where various
geographic names-including alternate names, former names, political or
geographical portions of larger entities, and the location of all US
Foreign Service Posts-can be found in The World Factbook. Spellings
are normally, but not always, those approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). Alternate names are included in parentheses,
while additional information is included in brackets.

Geography: This category includes the entries dealing with the natural
environment and the effects of human activity.

Geography-note: This entry includes miscellaneous geographic
information of significance not included elsewhere.

GNP: Gross national product (GNP) is the value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
by its citizens abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from
domestic production. The Factbook uses GDP rather than GNP to measure
national production.

Government: This category includes the entries dealing with the system
for the adoption and administration of public policy.

Government type: This entry gives the basic form of government (e.g.,
republic, constitutional monarchy, federal republic, parliamentary
democracy, military dictatorship).

Government-note: This entry includes miscellaneous government
information of significance not included elsewhere.

takeoff and landing sites (which may or may not have fuel or other
services).

Highways: This entry includes the total length of the highway system
as well as the length of the paved and unpaved components.

Historical perspective: This entry at the beginning of a country
profile contains a brief summary of the background information
necessary to understand the current situation in a country. The entry
appears for only a few countries at the present time, but may be added
to more countries in the future.

Illicit drugs: This entry gives information on the five categories of
illicit drugs- narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives),
hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories include many drugs
legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally
produced and sold outside of medical channels.
Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which
provides hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes
marijuana (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC, Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).
Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that
contain the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused
with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making
chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.
Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca
bush.
Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and
anxiety and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal,
Seconal, phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium),
methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil,
Placidyl, Valmid).
Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,
mental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.
Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical
substance that results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral
impairment in an individual.
Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,
self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,
microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine
variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),
phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,
psilocyn).
Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).
Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.
Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical
depressant.
Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).
Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as
mandrax in Southwest Asia.
Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep,
and refer to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes.
Natural narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine
(MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with
codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include
heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic
narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),
methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).
Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe
seedpod of the opium poppy.
Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the
natural and semisynthetic narcotics.
Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the
mature, dried opium poppy.
Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of
Catha edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.
Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone,
a pharmaceutical depressant.
Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase
energy and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack),
amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin),
methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Imports: This entry includes three subfields. Total value is the total
US dollar amount of imports on a c.i.f. or f.o.b. basis. Commodities
is a rank ordering of imported products starting with the most
important and sometimes includes the percent of dollar value. Partners
is a rank ordering of trading partners starting with the most
important and sometimes includes the percent of dollar value.

Independence: For most countries, this entry gives the date that
sovereignty was achieved, and from what nation, empire, or
trusteeship. For the other countries, the date given may not represent
''independence'' in the strict sense, but rather some significant
nationhood event such as traditional founding date, date of
unification, federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental
change in the form of government, or state succession. Dependent areas
include the notation ''none'' followed by the nature of their
dependency status. Also see the Terminology note.

Industrial production growth rate: This entry gives the annual
percentage increase in industrial production (includes manufacturing,
mining, and construction).

Industries: This entry provides a rank ordering of industries starting
with the largest by value of annual output.

Infant mortality rate: This entry gives the number of deaths of
infants under one year old in a given year per 1,000 live births
occurring in the same year. The infant mortality rate is often used an
indicator of the level of health in a country.

Inflation rate-consumer price index: This entry furnishes the annual
percent change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's
consumer prices.

International disputes: see Disputes-international

International organization participation: This entry lists in
alphabetical order by abbreviation those international organizations
in which the subject country is a member or participates in some other
way.

International organizations: This information is presented in Appendix
C: International Organizations and Groups which includes the name,
abbreviation, address, telephone, FAX, date established, aim, and
members by category.

Introduction: This category includes two entries-Current issues and
Historical perspective. At present it appears in only a few country
profiles, but may be added to others in the future.

Irrigated land: This entry gives the number of square kilometers of
land area that is artificially supplied with water.

Judicial branch: This entry contains the name(s) of the highest
court(s) and a brief description of the selection process for members.

Labor force: This entry contains the total labor force figure and a
rank ordering of component parts by occupation.

Land boundaries: This entry contains the total length of all land
boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous
border countries.

Land use: This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area
for five different types of land use. Arable land-land cultivated for
crops that are replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and
rice. Permanent crops-land cultivated for crops that are not replanted
after each harvest like citrus, coffee, and rubber. Permanent
pastures-land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops. Forests
and woodland-land under dense or open stands of trees. Other- any land
type not specifically mentioned above, such as urban areas, roads,
desert, etc.

Languages: This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting
with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total
population speaking that language.

Legal system: This entry contains a brief description of the legal
system's historical roots, role in government, and acceptance of
International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction.

Legislative branch: This entry contains information on the structure
(unicameral, bicameral, tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and
term of office. Elections includes the nature of election process or
accession to power, date of the last election, and date of the next
election. Election results includes the percent of vote and/or number
of seats held by each party in the last election.

Life expectancy at birth: This entry contains the average number of
years to be lived by a group of people born in the same year, if
mortality at each age remains constant in the future. The entry
includes total population as well as the male and female components.
Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality of life
in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also be
thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human
capital and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial
measures.

Literacy: This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census
Bureau percentages for the total population, males, and females. There
are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless
otherwise specified, all rates are based on the most common
definition-the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing
the standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to
read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on
literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is
probably the most easily available and valid for international
comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can
impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly
changing, technology-driven world.

Location: This entry identifies the country's regional location,
neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.

Map references: This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference
map on which a country may be found. The entry on Geographic
coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.

Maritime claims: This entry includes the following claims: contiguous
zone, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing
zone, extended fishing zone, none (usually for a landlocked country),
other (unique maritime claims like Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line
or North Korea's Military Boundary Line), and territorial sea. The
proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national claims from
being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged
in the carriage of goods; all commercial vessels (as opposed to all
nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil
rigs, etc.; or a grouping of merchant ships by nationality or
register. This entry contains information in two subfields-total and
ships by type. Total includes the total number of ships (1,000 GRT or
over), total DWT for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. Ships
by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships, cargo
ships, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers,
container ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock
carriers, multifunction large-load carriers, oil tankers, passenger
ships, passenger-cargo ships, railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo
ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships, short-sea passenger ships,
specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and vehicle carriers.
A captive register is a register of ships maintained by a
territory, possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use
of ships owned in the parent country; it is also referred to as an
offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an internal register.
Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the parent
country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime
laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature
of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may
also be owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of
convenience register, except that it is not the register of an
independent state.
A flag of convenience register is a national register
offering registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state.
The major flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers
by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and
liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by
having relatively few of the registered ships actually owned in the
flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under
a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the
majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to
as an open register.
A flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and
which holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at
home or abroad. Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how
a ship is crewed and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be
placed on the register.
An internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of
a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register. These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits, use of foreign
nationals as crew members, and, usually, ownership outside the flag
state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian
International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are
the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been
instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of
convenience and in attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and
Danish flags.
A merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against
payment of freight; it is commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship
but accurately restricted to commercial vessels only.
A register is the record of a ship's ownership and
nationality as listed with the maritime authorities of a country;
also, it is the compendium of such individual ships' registrations.
Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it
subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag
state) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Military: This category includes the entries dealing with a country's
military structure, manpower, and expenditures.

Military branches: This entry lists the names of the ground, naval,
air, marine, and other defense or military-type forces.

Military expenditures-dollar figure: This entry gives current military
expenditures in US dollars; the figure is calculated by multiplying
the estimated defense spending in percentage terms by the gross
domestic product (GDP) calculated on an exchange rate basis not
purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. The figure should be treated with
caution because of different price patterns and accounting methods
among nations, as well as wide variations in the strength of their
currencies.

Military expenditures-percent of GDP: This entry gives current
military expenditures as an estimated percent of gross domestic
product (GDP).

Military manpower-availability: This entry gives the total numbers of
males and females age 15-49 and assumes that every individual is fit
to serve.

Military manpower-fit for military service: This entry gives the
number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military service. This
is a more refined measure of potential military manpower availability
which tries to correct for the health situation in the country and
reduces the maximum potential number to a more realistic estimate of
the actual number fit to serve.

Military manpower-military age: This entry gives the minimum age at
which an individual may volunteer for military service or be subject
to conscription.

Military manpower-reaching military age annually: This entry gives the
number of draft-age males and females entering the military manpower
pool in any given year and is a measure of the availability of
draft-age young adults.

Military-note: This entry includes miscellaneous military information
of significance not included elsewhere.

Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National capital: This entry gives the location of the seat of
government.

National holiday: This entry gives the primary national day of
celebration- usually independence day.

Nationality: This entry provides the identifying terms for
citizens-noun and adjective.

Natural hazards: This entry lists potential natural disasters.

Natural resources: This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum,
hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.

Net migration rate: This entry includes the figure for the difference
between the number of persons entering and leaving a country during
the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear population). An excess of
persons entering the country is referred to as net immigration (e.g.,
3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000 population). The
net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration to the
overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause
problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife
(if people are coming in) or reducing the labor force, perhaps in
certain key sectors (if people are leaving).

People: This category includes the entries dealing with the
characteristics of the people and their society.

People-note: This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information
of significance not included elsewhere.

Pipelines: This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for
transporting products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum
products.

Political parties and leaders: This entry includes a listing of
significant political organizations and their leaders.

Political pressure groups and leaders: This entry includes a listing
of organizations with leaders involved in politics, but not standing
for legislative election.

Population: This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the
Census based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics
registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past
and on assumptions about future trends. The total population presents
one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the
world and within its region. Note: starting with the 1993 Factbook,
demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken
into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections.
In 1998 these countries are Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma,
Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia,
Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria,
Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Zambia,
and Zimbabwe.

Population growth rate: The average annual percent change in the
population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over
deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The
rate may be positive or negative. Also known as growth rate or average
annual rate of growth. The growth rate is a factor in determining how
great a burden would be imposed on a country by the changing needs of
its people for infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing,
roads), resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid
population growth can be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.

Ports and harbors: This entry lists the major ports and harbors
selected on the basis of overall importance to each country. This is
determined by evaluating a number of factors (e.g., dollar value of
goods handled, gross tonnage, facilities, military significance).

Radio broadcast stations: This entry includes the total number of AM,
FM, and shortwave broadcast stations.

Radios: This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.

Railways: This entry includes the total length of the railway network
and component parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard, and
other.

Reference maps: This section includes world, regional, and special or
current interest maps.

Religions: This entry includes a rank ordering of religions starting
with the largest and sometimes includes the percent of total
population.

Sex ratio: This entry includes the number of males for each female in
five age groups-at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and
over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently
emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some
countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian
countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide
due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage
patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually it could cause unrest
among young adult males who are unable to find partners. The sex ratio
at birth for the World is 1.06 (1998 est.).

Suffrage: This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the
right to vote is universal or restricted.

Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of
the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)
in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not
presented is the international access code, which varies from country
to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call
placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:
011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where
    011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls
    (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),
    [34] is the country code for Spain,
    (1) is the city code for Madrid,
    577 is the local exchange, and
    xxxx is the local telephone number.

An international direct dial telephone call placed from another
country to the US would be as follows:

international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx, where
    [1] is the country code for the US,
    (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,
    939 is the local exchange, and
    xxxx is the local telephone number.

satellite earth station-a communications facility with a
microwave radio transmitting and receiving antenna and required
receiving and transmitting equipment for communicating with
satellites.
satellite link-a radio connection between a satellite and an
earth station permitting communication between them, either one-way
(down link from satellite to earth station-television receive-only
transmission) or two-way (telephone channels).
SHF-super-high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 3,000-
to 30,000-MHz range.
shortwave-radio frequencies (from 1.605 to 30 MHz) that fall
above the commercial broadcast band and are used for communication
over long distances.
Solidaridad-geosynchronous satellites in Mexico's system of
international telecommunications in the Western Hemisphere.
Statsionar-Russia's geostationary system for satellite
telecommunications.
submarine cable-a cable designed for service under water.
TAT-Trans-Atlantic Telephone; any of a number of
high-capacity submarine coaxial telephone cables linking Europe with
North America.
telefax-facsimile service between subscriber stations via the
public switched telephone network or the international Datel network.
telegraph-a telecommunications system designed for
unmodulated electric impulse transmission.
telex-a communication service involving teletypewriters
connected by wire through automatic exchanges.
tropospheric scatter-a form of microwave radio transmission
in which the troposphere is used to scatter and reflect a fraction of
the incident radio waves back to earth; powerful, highly directional
antennas are used to transmit and receive the microwave signals;
reliable over-the-horizon communications are realized for distances up
to 600 miles in a single hop; additional hops can extend the range of
this system for very long distances.
trunk network-a network of switching centers, connected by
multichannel trunk lines.
UHF-ultra-high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 300- to
3,000-MHz range.
VHF-very-high-frequency; any radio frequency in the 30- to
300-MHz range.

Telephones: This entry gives the total number of subscribers.

Television-broadcast stations: This entry gives the total number of
separate broadcast stations plus any repeater stations.

Televisions: This entry gives the total number of television sets.

Terminology: Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook
database, some collective generic terms have to be used. For example,
the word Country in the Country name entry refers to a wide variety of
dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and
other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent
states. Military is also used as an umbrella term for various civil
defense, security, and defense activities in many entries. The
Independence entry includes the usual colonial independence dates and
former ruling states as well as other significant nationhood dates
such as the traditional founding date or the date of unification,
federation, confederation, establishment, or state succession that are
not strictly independence dates. Dependent areas have the nature of
their dependency status noted in this same entry. The National Capital
entry includes the first-order administrative seat for ''nations'' or
independent states as well as dependencies and other Factbook
entities.

Terrain: This entry contains a brief description of the topography.

Total fertility rate: This entry gives a figure for the average number
of children that would be born per woman if all women lived to the end
of their childbearing years and bore children according to a given
fertility rate at each age. The total fertility rate is a more direct
measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since it
refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential for
population growth in the country. High rates will also place some
limits on the labor force participation rates for women. Large numbers
of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit
the capacity of the families to educate their children.

Transnational Issues: This category includes only two entries at the
present time-Disputes-international and Illicit drugs-that deal with
current issues going beyond national boundaries.

Transportation: This category includes the entries dealing with the
movement of people or material.

Transportation-note: This entry includes miscellaneous transportation
information of significance not included elsewhere.

Unemployment rate: This entry contains the percent of the labor force
that is without jobs. Substantial underemployment might be noted.

United Nations System: This information is presented in Appendix B:
United Nations System as a chart, table, or text (depending on the
version of the Factbook) that shows the organization of the UN in
detail.

Waterways: This entry gives the total length and individual names of
navigable rivers, canals, and other inland bodies of water.

Weights and measures: This information is presented in Appendix E:
Weights and Measures and includes mathematical notations (mathematical
powers and names), metric interrelationships (prefix; symbol; length,
weight, or capacity; area; volume), and standard conversion factors.

Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless
indicated as fiscal year (FY). The calendar year is an accounting
period of 12 months from 1 January to 31 December. The fiscal year is
an accounting period of 12 months other than 1 January to 31 December.
FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that began in calendar year 1993 and
ended in calendar year 1994.

Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from
material in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence
Community estimates. The Handbook of International Economic
Statistics, published annually in September by the Central
Intelligence Agency, contains detailed economic information for the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries, the successor nations to the Soviet Union, and selected
other countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever the Factbook is
available.
