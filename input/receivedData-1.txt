@Ghana:Economy

Economy-overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana has twice
the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa. Even so,
Ghana remains heavily dependent on international financial and
technical assistance. Gold, timber, and cocoa production are major
sources of foreign exchange. The domestic economy continues to revolve
around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 41% of GDP and
employs 60% of the work force, mainly small landholders. In 1995-97,
Ghana made mixed progress under a three-year structural adjustment
program in cooperation with the IMF. On the minus side, public sector
wage increases and regional peacekeeping commitments have led to
continued inflationary deficit financing, depreciation of the cedi,
and rising public discontent with Ghana's austerity measures.

@Gibraltar:Economy

Economy-overview: Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade,
offshore banking, and its position as an international conference
center. The British military presence has been sharply reduced and now
contributes about 11% to the local economy. The financial sector
accounts for 15% of GDP; tourism (more than 5 million visitors in
1995), shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also
generate revenue. Because more than 70% of the economy is in the
public sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on
the level of employment.

@Greece:Economy

Economy-overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the
public sector accounting for roughly half of GDP. Tourism provides a
major portion of foreign exchange. Greece is among the poorest EU
countries in terms of per capita income; Athens continues to rely
heavily on EU aid, which currently amounts to about 4.5% of GDP.
Macroeconomic problems include the huge public sector, substantial
budget and balance of payments deficits, and 10% unemployment.
Economic growth is strengthening, and the government's strict fiscal
and monetary policies are responsible for the decline in inflation and
the budget deficit. Despite widespread protests from labor unions and
farmers over austerity, the government is taking further steps to
enhance revenue collection and reduce expenditures to prepare Greece
for participation in the EU's single currency by 2001. Greece entered
the exchange rate mechanism-a requirement for European Monetary Union
(EMU) membership-in March 1998. GDP growth is projected at 3.5% for
1998, inflation at 4%, and unemployment at 8.5%

@Greenland:Economy

Economy-overview: Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the
early 1990s, but since 1993 the economy has improved. The Greenland
Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a light fiscal policy since
the late 1980s which has helped create surpluses in the public budget
and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign
trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and
zinc mine in 1989. Greenland today is critically dependent on fishing
and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far the largest income
earner. Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and
minerals exploration activities, it will take several years before
production can materialize. Tourism is the only sector offering any
near-term potential and even this is limited due to a short season and
high costs. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises
and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's
economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the
Danish Government, an important supplement of GDP.

@Grenada:Economy

Economy-overview: The agriculturally based economy was hurt in 1996 by
the emergence of the pink mealy bug, which destroyed much of the cocoa
harvest. Bananas, a major foreign exchange earner, also suffered due
to falling prices, low production, and poor quality. Tourism, the
leading foreign exchange earner, continued to do well, as did
manufacturing. Construction boomed in 1996 due to concessions for low
and middle income mortgages. The government introduced a 5% tax on
electricity and telephones and doubled the general consumption tax,
which caused a small rise in the inflation rate. The tourist industry
faces stiff competition over the next few years.

@Guadeloupe:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It is also dependent upon France for large
subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists
from the US; an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
islands. The traditional sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by
other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of export
earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops are
cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still
dependent on imported food, mainly from France. Light industry
features sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel
are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young.

boom for new hotels and the expansion of older ones. More than one
million tourists visit Guam each year. Most food and industrial goods
are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam faces the problem of
building up the civilian economic sector to offset the impact of
military downsizing.

@Guatemala:Economy

Economy-overview: The agricultural sector accounts for one-fourth of
GDP and two-thirds of exports and employs more than half of the labor
force. Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the main products. Manufacturing
and construction account for one-fifth of GDP. Since assuming office
in January 1996, President ARZU has worked to implement a program of
economic liberalization and political modernization. The signing of
the Peace Accords in December 1996, which ended 36 years of civil war,
removed a major obstacle to foreign investment. In 1997, Guatemala met
its economic targets when GDP growth accelerated to 4.1% and inflation
fell to 9%. The government also increased tax revenues-historically
the lowest in Latin America-to 9% of GDP and created a new tax
administration. It also successfully placed $150 million in
dollar-denominated notes in the international markets. Debt service
costs should decline in 1998. Remaining challenges for the
administration in 1998 include completing a deal with the IMF and
stabilizing monetary policy. Throughout 1997, the Central Bank
maintained a tight money supply, helping to control inflation, but it
also caused high interest rates and led to operating losses for the
bank. Early in 1998, it relaxed its monetary policy in an effort to
correct these problems, but increased pressure on the quetzal has
prompted the bank to intervene to prop up its value.

@Guinea:Economy

Economy-overview: Although possessing major mineral, hydropower, and
agricultural resources, Guinea remains one of the poorest countries in
the world. The agricultural sector employs 80% of the work force.
Guinea possesses over 25% of the world's bauxite reserves and is the
second largest bauxite producer. The mining sector accounted for about
75% of exports in 1995. Long-run improvements in government fiscal
arrangements, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the
country is to move out of poverty. The government made encouraging
progress in budget management in 1997. Except in the mining industry,
foreign investment remains minimal.

@Guinea-Bissau:Economy

Economy-overview: One of the 20 poorest countries in the world,
Guinea-Bissau depends mainly on farming and fishing. Cashew crops have
increased remarkably in recent years, and the country now ranks sixth
in cashew production. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along
with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the
major crop and staple food. Trade reform and price liberalization are
the most successful part of the country's structural adjustment
program under IMF sponsorship. The tightening of monetary policy and
the development of the private sector have begun to reinvigorate the
economy. Inflation dropped sharply in the first quarter of 1997.
Membership in the WAMU (West African Monetary Union), begun in May
1997, should help support 5% annual growth and contribute to fiscal
discipline. Because of high costs, the development of petroleum,
phosphate, and other mineral resources is not a near-term prospect.

@Guyana:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997, Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the
Western Hemisphere, posted its sixth straight year of economic growth
of 5% or better, with the advance led by gold and bauxite mining and
by sugar growing. Favorable growth factors have included expansion in
the key agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable atmosphere
for business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a moderate
inflation rate, and the continued support of international
organizations. Serious underlying economic problems will continue.
Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
barrier to future gains in national output. The government must
persist in efforts to manage its sizable external debt and extend its
privatization program.

@Haiti:Economy

Economy-overview: About 75% of the population lives in abject poverty.
Nearly 70% of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector, which
consists mainly of small-scale subsistence farming and employs about
two-thirds of the economically active work force. The country has
experienced little or no job creation since President PREVAL took
office in February 1996, although the informal economy is growing.
Failure to reach agreements with international sponsors have denied
Haiti badly needed budget and development assistance. Meeting aid
conditions in 1998 will be especially challenging in the face of
mounting popular criticism of reforms.

@Honduras:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1994 the REINA administration inherited an
economy in the grips of stagflation due to an unprecedented energy
crisis, declining agricultural output, and extravagant public
expenditures. In response the REINA administration cut the fiscal
deficit and enacted a number of structural reforms including passage
of a modern financial sector reform law in 1995 and a central bank
reform law in 1996. As a result, Honduras finished 1997 with improved
GDP growth and a decreasing rate of inflation. The newly elected
FLORES administration faces pressure from the international financial
community and the IMF to further decrease the fiscal deficit and
implement key reforms, including the privatization of state
enterprises such as Hondutel. Tegucigalpa will probably implement
tighter fiscal and monetary policies to keep inflation low and meet
commitments to the IMF. This may slow GDP growth to 3.5% in 1998.
Moreover, wage increases for public-sector employees, agreed to in
1997, will make it difficult for FLORES to make headway on the fiscal
deficit and inflation.

@Hong Kong:Economy

Economy-overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy highly
dependent on international trade. Natural resources are limited, and
food and raw materials must be imported. Indeed, imports and exports,
including reexports, each exceed GDP in dollar value. Real GDP growth
averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and
picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993, 5.5% in 1994,
4.8% in 1995, 4.7% in 1996, and an estimated 5.5% in 1997. A shortage
of labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of
living. Even before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese administration on 1
July 1997 it had extensive trade and investment ties with China.

@Hungary:Economy

Economy-overview: Hungary has consolidated its March 1995
stabilization program and undergone enough restructuring to become an
established market economy. The country appears to have entered a
period of sustainable growth, gradually falling inflation, and stable
external balances. The government's main economic priorities are to
complete structural reforms, particularly the implementation of the
1997 pension reform act (the first in the region), taxation reform,
and planning for comprehensive health care, local government finance
reform, and the reform of education at all levels. Foreign investment
has totaled more than $17 billion through 1997. In recognition of
Hungary's improved macro-economic situation, all major credit-rating
agencies listed the country's foreign currency debt issuances as
investment grade in 1996. The current IMF stand-by arrangement expired
in February 1998, and Budapest and the IMF agree that there is no need
to renew it. The OECD welcomed Hungary as a member in May 1996, and in
December 1997 the EU invited Hungary to begin the accession process.

@Iceland:Economy

Economy-overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
capitalistic, yet with an extensive welfare system, low unemployment,
and remarkably even distribution of income. The economy depends
heavily on the fishing industry, which provides 75% of export earnings
and employs 12% of the work force. In the absence of other natural
resources-except energy-Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing
world fish prices. The economy remains sensitive to declining fish
stocks as well as to drops in world prices for its main exports: fish
and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. The center-right
government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and
current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing
inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying
the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The government
remains opposed to EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders'
concern about losing control over their fishing resources. Growth is
likely to slow in 1998, to a still respectable 3.9%.

@India:Economy

Economy-overview: India's economy encompasses traditional village
farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern
industries, and a multitude of support services. 67% of India's labor
force of nearly 400 million work in agriculture, which contributes 30%
of the country's GDP. Production, trade, and investment reforms since
1991 have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons and an
estimated 300 million middle class consumers. New Delhi has avoided
debt rescheduling, attracted foreign investment, and revived
confidence in India's economic prospects since 1991. Many of the
country's fundamentals - including savings rates (26% of GDP) and
reserves (now about $24 billion) - are healthy. Inflation eased to 7%
in 1997, and interest rates dropped to between 10% and 13%. Even so,
the Indian Government needs to restore the early momentum of reform,
especially by continuing reductions in the extensive remaining
government regulations. Moreover, economic policy changes have not yet
significantly increased jobs or reduced the risk that international
financial strains will reemerge within the next few years. Nearly 40%
of the Indian population remains too poor to afford an adequate diet.
India's exports, currency, and foreign institutional investment were
affected by the East Asian crisis in late 1997 and early 1998, but
capital account controls, a low ratio of short-term debt to reserves,
and enhanced supervision of the financial sector helped insulate it
from near term balance-of-payments problems. Export growth, has been
slipping in 1996-97, averaging only about 4% to 5%-a large drop from
the more than 20% increases it was experiencing over the prior three
years-mainly because of the fall in Asian currencies relative to the
rupee. Energy, telecommunications, and transportation shortages and
the legacy of inefficient factories constrain industrial growth which
expanded only 6.7% in 1997-down from more than 11% in 1996. Growth of
the agricultural sector is still fairly slow rebounding to only 5.7%
in 1997 from a fall of 0.1% in 1996. Agricultural investment has
slowed, while costly subsidies on fertilizer, food distribution, and
rural electricity remain. Nevertheless, even if a series of weak
coalition governments continue to rule in New Delhi over the next few
years and are unable to push reforms aggressively, parts of the
economy that have already benefited from deregulation will continue to
grow. Indian think tanks project GDP growth of at least 5.5% in 1998.

@Indian Ocean:Economy

Economy-overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes
connecting the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the
Americas. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and
petroleum products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and
Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the
bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing
fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian
Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are
being tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and
western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil
production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy
minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by
bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri
Lanka, and Thailand.

@Indonesia:Economy

Economy-overview: While Indonesia was long touted for its sound
macroeconomic management and spectacular growth, the Asian financial
crisis in 1997/98 revealed the weak underpinnings of the economy: an
unhealthy banking sector, untenable levels of private foreign debt,
and uncompetitive practices that favored the financial interests of
former President SOEHARTO's family and friends. Indonesia sought IMF
assistance early in the crisis and eventually brokered a $42 billion
bailout package; but Jakarta jeopardized the program by resisting
strict IMF reforms, partly in response to the rupiah's collapse, which
lost as much as 80% of its value at one point. Economic prospects look
bleak for 1998: the economy probably will shrink between 4% to 10%,
unemployment top historic highs-in excess of 15%-and inflation move
toward hyper levels.

@Iran:Economy

Economy-overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning,
state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village
agriculture, and small-scale private trading and service ventures.
Newly elected President KHATAMI has continued to follow the market
reform plans of former President RAFSANJANI and has indicated that he
will pursue diversification of Iran's oil-reliant economy. In the
early 1990s, Iran experienced a financial crisis and was forced to
reschedule $15 billion in debt. The strong oil market in 1996 helped
ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran's timely debt
service payments. Iran's financial situation tightened in 1997 and
early 1998 because of lower oil prices. Iran may be forced to decrease
imports and slow debt repayments if the oil market worsens further.

@Iraq:Economy

Economy-overview: The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central
planning and management of industrial production and foreign trade
while leaving some small-scale industry and services and most
agriculture to private enterprise. The economy has been dominated by
the oil sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign
exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export
facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures
and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments; Iraq
suffered economic losses of at least $100 billion from the war. After
the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor
shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land
reform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although
accorded high priority by the government, also was under financial
constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent
international economic embargoes, and military action by an
international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed
the economic picture. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced
exports and imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices.
The Iraqi Government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so
that the economic embargo could be removed. The government's policies
of supporting large military and internal security forces and of
allocating resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated
shortages. Industrial and transportation facilities, which suffered
severe damage, have been partially restored. At current prices, oil
exports are about one-third of their prewar level because of the
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 986-the UN's
oil-for-goods program-in December 1996. Shortages of spare parts
continue. In accord with the oil-for-goods deal, Iraq is allowed to
export $2 billion worth of oil in exchange for badly needed food and
medicine. The first oil was pumped in December 1996, and the first
supplies of food and medicine arrived in April 1997. Per capita output
for 1995-97 and living standards are well below the 1989-90 level, but
any estimates have a wide range of error.

@Ireland:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is small and trade dependent.
Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by
industry, which accounts for 38% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and
employs 27% of the labor force. Although exports remain the primary
engine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also benefiting
from a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both construction and
business investment. Since the 1980s, inflation has fallen sharply and
chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses.
Unemployment remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is
the main focus of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin
aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new
industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms.

Central, Haifa, Jerusalem, Northern, Southern, Tel Aviv

Independence: 14 May 1948 (from League of Nations mandate under

independence on 14 May 1948, but the Jewish calendar is lunar and the
holiday may occur in April or May)

Constitution: no formal constitution; some of the functions of a
constitution are filled by the Declaration of Establishment (1948),
the basic laws of the parliament (Knesset), and the Israeli
citizenship law

regulations, and, in personal matters, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim
legal systems; in December 1985, Israel informed the UN Secretariat
that it would no longer accept compulsory ICJ jurisdiction

casts two ballots-one for the direct election of the prime minister
and one for the party in the Knesset; the candidate that receives the
largest percentage of the popular vote then works to form a coalition
with other parties to achieve a parliamentary majority of 61 seats;
finally, the candidate must submit his or her cabinet to the Knesset
for approval and this must be done within 45 days of the election; in
contrast to the old system, under the new law, the prime minister's
party need not be the single-largest party in the Knesset

@Israel:Economy

Economy-overview: Israel has a technologically advanced market economy
with substantial government participation. It depends on imports of
crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment. Despite
limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its
agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
Manufacturing and construction employ about 28% of Israeli workers;
agriculture, forestry, and fishing only 2.6%; and services the rest.
Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for
grains. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products
(fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts
sizable current account deficits, which are covered by large transfer
payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the
government's external debt is owed to the US, which is its major
source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange,
Israel has been targeting high-technology niches in international
markets, such as medical scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish
immigrants from the former USSR topped 750,000 during the period
1989-97, bringing the population of Israel from the former Soviet
Union to one million, or one-sixth of the total population. Initially
this great influx increased unemployment, intensified housing
problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the
immigrants bring to the economy scientific and professional expertise
of substantial value for the future.

@Italy:Economy

Economy-overview: Since World War II, the Italian economy has changed
from one based on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with
approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
UK. This basically capitalistic economy is still divided into a
developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less
developed agricultural south, with large public enterprises and more
than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and over
75% of energy requirements must be imported. In the second half of
1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to
participate in EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the
decade; thus, it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances.
Subsequently, the government has adopted fairly stringent budgets,
abandoned its inflationary wage indexation system, and started to
scale back its generous social welfare programs, including pension and
health care benefits. In November 1996 the lire rejoined the European
monetary system, which it had left in September 1992 when under
extreme pressure in currency markets. Italy faces the problem of
restructuring its economy to meet Maastricht criteria for inclusion in
the EMU, together with other problems of refurbishing a tottering
communications system, curbing industrial pollution, and adjusting to
new EU and global competitive forces.

@Jamaica:Economy

Economy-overview: Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite
(alumina and bauxite account for more than half of exports) and
tourism. Since assuming office in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has
eliminated most price controls, streamlined tax schedules, and
privatized government enterprises. Continued tight monetary and fiscal
policies have helped slow inflation and stabilize the exchange rate,
but have resulted in the slow-down of economic growth (moving from
1.5% in 1992 to 0.5% in 1995. In 1996, GDP was in negative growth
(-1.4%) and remained so in 1997. Serious problems include: high
interest rates; increased foreign competition; the weak financial
condition of business in general resulting in receiverships or
closures and downsizings of companies; the shift in investment
portfolios to non-productive, short-term high yield instruments; a
pressured, sometimes sliding, exchange rate; a widening merchandise
trade deficit; and a growing internal debt for government bailouts to
various ailing sectors of the economy. Jamaica's medium-term prospects
will depend upon encouraging investment in the productive sectors,
maintaining a competitive exchange rate, stabilizing the labor
environment, and implementing proper fiscal and monetary policies.

@Japan:Economy

Economy-overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work
ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
allocation (roughly 1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with
extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most powerful economy in
the world. One notable characteristic of the economy is the working
together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in closely knit
groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the guarantee
of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor
force; this guarantee is eroding. Industry, the most important sector
of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
fuels. The much smaller agricultural sector is highly subsidized and
protected, with crop yields among the highest in the world. Usually
self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of
the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth had been
spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s,
and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in 1992-95
largely because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the late
1980s and contractionary domestic policies intended to wring
speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth
picked up to 3.9% in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative fiscal
and monetary policies as well as low rates of inflation. But in 1997
growth fell back to 1%. As a result of the expansionary fiscal
policies and declining tax revenues due to the recession, Japan has
one of the largest budget deficits as a percent of GDP among the
industrialized countries. The crowding of habitable land area and the
aging of the population are two other major long-run problems.

@Jersey:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based largely on financial services,
agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and
especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the
UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents
an important export earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU
countries. In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism as the main
contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the island's output. In
recent years, the government has encouraged light industry to locate
in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed
alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material
and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
Jersey's food needs. Light tax and death duties make the island a
popular tax haven.

@Jordan:Economy

Economy-overview: Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate
supplies of water and other natural resources such as oil and coal.
Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the
late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth averaged
more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in
both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an
average of roughly 2% per year. Imports-mainly oil, capital goods,
consumer durables, and food-outstripped exports, with the difference
covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian
Government began debt-rescheduling negotiations and agreed to
implement an IMF-supported program designed to gradually reduce the
budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated
Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the government to
shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend
rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker
remittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country,
producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth,
and straining government resources. The economy rebounded in 1992,
largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers returning
from the Gulf, but recovery was uneven in 1994-97. The government is
implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and continues to
secure rescheduling and write-offs of its heavy foreign debt. Debt,
poverty, and unemployment remain Jordan's biggest on-going problems.

@Kazakhstan:Economy

Economy-overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet
republics in territory, possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel
reserves as well as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals.
It also has considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe
lands accommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's
industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural
machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the
collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry
products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995-97
the pace of the government program of economic reform and
privatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets
into the private sector. The December 1996 signing of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from western
Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field to the Black Sea increases prospects for
substantially larger oil exports in several years. The emigration of
large numbers of skilled Slavic managers and technicians from the
northern industrial areas will hold back future growth.

@Kenya:Economy

Economy-overview: Since 1993, the government of Kenya has implemented
a program of economic liberalization and reform. Steps have included
the removal of import licensing and price controls, removal of foreign
exchange controls, fiscal and monetary restraint, and reduction of the
public sector through privatizing publicly owned companies and
downsizing the civil service. With the support of the World Bank, IMF,
and other donors, these reforms have led to a turnaround in economic
performance following a period of negative growth in the early 1990s.
Kenya's real GDP grew at 5% in 1995 and 4% in 1996, and inflation
remained under control. Growth slowed in 1997. Political violence
damaged the tourist industry, and the IMF allowed Kenya's Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Program to lapse due to the government's failure
to enact reform conditions and to adequately address public sector
corruption. Moreover, El Nino rains destroyed crops and damaged an
already crumbling infrastructure in 1997 and on into 1998. Long-term
barriers to development include electricity shortages, the
government's continued and inefficient dominance of key sectors,
endemic corruption, and the country's high population growth rate.

@Kiribati:Economy

Economy-overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls,
Kiribati has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
deposits were exhausted at the time of independence from the UK in
1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports.
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP growth has
declined from about 10% in 1988 to about 2.6% in 1995 and 1.9% in
1996. Growth in 1997 was expected to parallel the 1996 performance.
Economic development is constrained by a shortage of skilled workers,
weak infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. The
financial sector is at an early stage of development as is the
expansion of private sector initiatives. Foreign financial aid,
largely from the UK and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, equal
in amount to 25%-50% of GDP in recent years. Remittances from workers
abroad account for more than $5 million each year.

@Korea, North:Economy

Economy-overview: More than 90% of this command economy is socialized;
agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces
95% of manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is
unusually tight even for a communist country because of the small size
and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song in
the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the
period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by an average of
4%-5% or more annually during 1989-97 because of systemic problems and
disruptions in economic and technological links with the former USSR
and China. The leadership has insisted on maintaining its high level
of military outlays from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious
drawdown in inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector
have led to increasing interruptions in industrial production.
Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed the basis of
industrial development since World War II. Manufacturing is centered
on heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry
lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties,
expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea
is not yet self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of
arable lands, several years of poor harvests, systemic inefficiencies,
a cumbersome distribution system, and extensive floods in 1995-96
followed by a severe drought in 1997 have resulted in increasingly
serious food shortages. Substantial grain shipments from Japan and
South Korea are offsetting a portion of the losses. North Korea
remains far behind South Korea in economic development and living
standards.

@Korea, South:Economy

Economy-overview: As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia, South Korea
has achieved an incredible record of growth. Three decades ago its GDP
per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of
Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per capita is eight times India's, 15
times North Korea's, and already up with the lesser economies of the
European Union. This success through the late 1980s was achieved by a
system of close government business ties, including directed credit,
import restrictions, sponsorship of specific industries, and a strong
labor effort. The government promoted the import of raw materials and
technology at the expense of consumer goods and encouraged savings and
investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997/98
exposed certain longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development
model, including high debt/equity ratios, massive foreign borrowing,
and an undisciplined financial sector. Also, a number of private
sector conglomerates are near bankruptcy. At yearend 1997, an
international effort, spearheaded by the IMF, was underway to shore up
reserves and stabilize the economy. Growth in 1998 will be sharply
cut. Long-term growth will depend on how successfully South Korea
implements planned economic reforms that would bolster the financial
sector, improve corporate management, and open the economy further to
foreign participation.

@Kuwait:Economy

Economy-overview: Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with
proved crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels-10% of world
reserves. Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its
crude oil production averaged 2 million barrels per day in 1996.
Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of export revenues, and
75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no
arable land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the
exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75%
of potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high
per capita income, Kuwait provides its citizens with extensive health,
educational, and retirement benefits. The bulk of the work force is
non-Kuwaiti, living at a considerably lower level. Per capita military
expenditures are among the highest in the world. The economy improved
moderately in 1994-97, with the growth in industry and finance. The
World Bank has urged Kuwait to push ahead with privatization,
including in the oil industry, but the government will move slowly on
opening the petroleum sector.

@Kyrgyzstan:Economy

Economy-overview: Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country
with a predominantly agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are
the main agricultural products and exports. Industrial exports include
gold, mercury, uranium, and hydropower. Kyrgyzstan has been one of the
most progressive countries of the former Soviet Union in carrying out
market reforms. Following a successful stabilization program, which
lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to 15% for 1997, attention is
turning toward stimulating growth. Much of the government's stock in
enterprises has been sold. Drops in production have been severe since
the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995
production began to recover and exports began to increase. Pensioners,
unemployed workers, and government workers with salary arrears
continue to suffer. Foreign assistance played a substantial role in
the country's economic turnaround in 1996-97.

@Laos:Economy

Economy-overview: The government of Laos-one of the few remaining
official communist states-has been decentralizing control and
encouraging private enterprise since 1986. The results, starting from
an extremely low base, have been striking - growth averaged 7% in
1988-96. Because Laos depends heavily on its trade with Thailand, it
fell victim to the financial crisis in the region in 1997, when growth
was a mere 1.5%. Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive
infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and
limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is
available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts
for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The predominant
crop is glutinous rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient
overall in food, but each year flood, pests, and localized drought
cause shortages in various parts of the country. For the foreseeable
future the economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and
other international sources; Japan is currently the largest bilateral
aid donor; aid from the former USSR/Eastern Europe has been cut
sharply. As in many developing countries, deforestation and soil
erosion will hamper efforts to regain a high rate of GDP growth.

@Latvia:Economy

Economy-overview: In 1997 Latvia scored the most impressive economic
achievements since independence in 1991, with GDP growing by 6% and
inflation at 7.4%. GDP is expected to grow 5% in 1998 and inflation to
range between 6% and 7%. In 1997 Latvia continued its strict fiscal
policy and apparently ended the year with a small fiscal surplus,
reflecting higher-than-expected income from customs revenues, excise
and business taxes, and restraints on government spending. Foreign
direct investment (FDI) in 1997 was a record $880 million by yearend.
Prospects for increasing FDI in 1998 are good if Latvia privatizes at
least some of its large companies, including Venspils Nafta (the state
oil company). Although Latvia was disappointed that it was not
included among the five Central and East European states invited to
start EU accession talks in spring 1998, it is likely to join the WTrO
in 1998. Latvia's growing current account and trade deficits remain a
cause for concern, reaching nearly 10% by yearend. Latvia's trade
deficit may even reach 22% of GDP in 1998.

LEBANON

Introduction

Current issues: Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its
political institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since
the end of the devastating 16-year civil war, which began in 1975.
Under the Ta'if Accord-the blueprint for national reconciliation-the
Lebanese have established a more equitable political system,
particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process
while institutionalizing sectarian divisions in the government. Since
the end of the civil war, the Lebanese have formed five cabinets and
conducted two legislative elections. Most of the militias have been
weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast
quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
central government authority over about one-half of the country.
Hizballah, the radical Shi'a party, retains most of its weapons.
Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops
in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, the Army
of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared
security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
Jazzin. Syria maintains about 25,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops
are based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley.
Syria's deployment was legitimized by the Arab League during Lebanon's
civil war and in the Ta'if accord. Citing the continued weakness of
the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the Lebanese Government to
implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord,
Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

@Lebanon:Economy

Economy-overview: The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but
ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
Peace has enabled the central government to restore control in Beirut,
begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government
facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound
banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers,
with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm
exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign
exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains since Prime
Minister HARIRI launched his $18 billion "Horizon 2000" reconstruction
program in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before
Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic
activity. During 1992-97, annual inflation fell from more than 170% to
9%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $4 billion from
$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign
payments surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively
stable. Progress also has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn
physical and financial infrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is
managing the reconstruction of Beirut's central business district; the
stock market reopened in January 1996; and international banks and
insurance companies are returning. The government nonetheless faces
serious challenges in the economic arena. It has had to fund
reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting
borrowing. The stalled peace process and ongoing violence in southern
Lebanon could lead to wider hostilities that would disrupt vital
capital inflows. Furthermore, the gap between rich and poor has
widened since HARIRI took office, resulting in grassroots
dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction's
benefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding
infrastructure to improving living conditions.

@Lesotho:Economy

Economy-overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no
important natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on
agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from miners employed
in South Africa. The number of such mine workers has declined steadily
over the past five years; in 1996 their remittances added about 33% to
GDP compared with the addition of roughly 67% in 1990. Manufacturing
depends largely on farm products which support the milling, canning,
leather, and jute industries. Recent foreign investments will enable
Lesotho to export garments made from imported textiles. Although
drought has decreased agricultural activity over the past few years,
completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 now permits
the sale of water to South Africa and will support the economy's
continued expansion. The pace of the privatization of state-owned
firms increased toward the end of 1994.

LIBERIA

Introduction

Current issues: The Abuja Peace Accords ended seven years of civil
warfare in Liberia. More than 20,000 of the estimated 33,000 factional
fighters gave up their arms to the Cease-Fire Monitoring Group of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG). Free and open
presidential and legislative elections were held 19 July 1997; former
faction leader, Charles TAYLOR, and his National Patriotic Party won
overwhelming victories. The years of civil strife coupled with the
flight of most business people disrupted formal economic activity, but
with peace restored and a popularly-elected government installed, the
difficult task of rebuilding the social and economic structure of this
war-torn country can proceed.

@Liberia:Economy

Economy-overview: Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Many
businessmen have fled the country, taking capital and expertise with
them. Some returned during 1997. Many will not return. Richly endowed
with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to
agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been
small in scope. The democratically elected government, installed in
August 1997, inherited massive international debts and currently
relies on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the bulk of
its foreign exchange earnings. The restoration of the infrastructure
and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy depends on
continued disarmament of factions and the implementation of sound
macro- and micro-economic policies of the new government.

@Libya:Economy

Economy-overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily
upon revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all
export earnings and about one-third of GDP. Per capita GDP is the
highest in Africa at $6,700, but disproportionately little of national
income flows down to the lower orders of society. GDP growth
fluctuates sharply in response to changes in the world oil market; GDP
has either contracted or grown very sluggishly since 1992. Import
restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to periodic
shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. The nonoil manufacturing and
construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have
expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to include the
production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although
agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs 18% of the labor
force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output,
and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. The UN sanctions
imposed in April 1992 do not have a major impact on the economy
although they have increased transaction and transportation costs.

@Liechtenstein:Economy

Economy-overview: Despite its small size and limited natural
resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service
sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large
European neighbors. Low business taxes-the maximum tax rate is 18%-and
easy incorporation rules have induced about 73,700 holding or
so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues. The country
participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss
franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy
requirements. Liechtenstein is a member of the European Economic Area
(an organization serving as a bridge between EFTA and EU) since May
1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies
with those of an integrated Europe.

@Lithuania:Economy

Economy-overview: Lithuania has benefited from its disciplined
approach to market reform and its adherence to strict fiscal and
monetary policies imposed by the IMF, measures that have helped
constrain the growth of the money supply, reduce inflation to 8.6%,
and support GDP growth of 6% in 1997. Inflation is expected to fall in
1998 to 6% and GDP to grow at close to 7%. Foreign direct investment
in 1997 of some $430 million pushed the country over the $1 billion
mark, the first Baltic state to reach this milestone. However, the
current account deficit has hovered around 8% to 10% of GDP annually
since 1995-the result of greater demand for consumer goods and falling
growth in exports.

@Luxembourg:Economy

Economy-overview: The stable, prosperous economy features moderate
growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Agriculture is based on
small family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently
dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified. During
the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than
compensated for the decline in steel. Services, especially banking,
account for a growing proportion of the economy. Luxembourg
participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most
financial matters, is also closely connected economically to the
Netherlands, and, as a member of the EU, enjoys the advantages of the
open European market.

@Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of:Economy

Economy-overview: The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although
the poorest republic in the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic
food and energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources.
The economy slowly rebounded in 1996-97 after years of recession.
Continued recovery depends on Macedonia's ability to attract
investment, to redevelop trade ties with Greece and Serbia and
Montenegro, and to maintain its commitment to economic liberalization.
The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and
most of its modern machinery and parts. An important supplement of GDP
is the remittances from thousands of Macedonians working in Germany
and other West European nations.

@Madagascar:Economy

Economy-overview: Madagascar suffers from chronic malnutrition,
underfunded health and education facilities, a roughly 3% annual
population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied
by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the
mainstay of the economy, accounting for 33% of GDP and contributing
more than 70% to export earnings. Industry features textile
manufacturing and the processing of agricultural products. Growth in
output in 1992-97 averaged less than the growth rate of the
population. Growth has been held back by antigovernment strikes and
demonstrations, a decline in world coffee demand, and the erratic
commitment of the government to economic reform. Formidable obstacles
stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable growth
potential; the extent of government reforms, outside financial aid,
and foreign investment will be key determinants.

accounts for 45% of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The economy
depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF,
the World Bank, and individual donor nations. The new government faces
strong challenges, e.g., to spur exports, to improve educational and
health facilities, and to deal with environmental problems of
deforestation and erosion.

@Malaysia:Economy

Economy-overview: After decades of high GDP growth, Malaysia's
economy-shaken by the ongoing regional financial crisis in 1997/98-is
forecast by the government to grow only 4%-5% in 1998; private
forecasts project the growth rate could be as low as 2%. The sharp
decline in local currency and stock markets forced Kuala Lumpur to
announce tough cost-cutting measures-on top of a contractionary
budget-to further reduce the current account deficit to 3% of GDP in
1998 from 5.5% in 1997. To achieve this goal, Kuala Lumpur will cut
government spending by 20% and continue to slash big-ticket imports
and defer large-scale infrastructure projects. Government austerity
and slower growth mean increased unemployment and higher interest
rates that will bite into corporate earnings.

@Maldives:Economy

Economy-overview: Tourism, Maldives largest industry, accounts for
about 18% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange
receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties
and tourism-related taxes. About 350,000 tourists visited the islands
in 1997. Fishing is a second leading growth sector. The Maldivian
Government began an economic reform program in 1989 initially by
lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector.
Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign
investment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a minor
role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of
cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods
must be imported. Industry, which consists mainly of garment
production, boat building, and handicrafts, accounts for about 15% of
GDP. Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion and
possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the area is
three feet or less above sea level.

@Mali:Economy

Economy-overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the world,
with 65% of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is
largely confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About
10% of the population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is
engaged in farming and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on
processing farm commodities. Mali is heavily dependent on foreign aid
and vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for cotton, its main
export. In 1997, the government continued its successful
implementation of an IMF-recommended structural adjustment program
that is helping the economy grow, diversify, and attract foreign
investment. Mali's adherence to economic reform, and the 50%
devaluation of the African franc in January 1994, has pushed up
economic growth. Several multinational corporations increased gold
mining operations in 1996 and the government anticipates that Mali
will become a major Sub-Saharan gold exporter in the next few years.

@Malta:Economy

Economy-overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable
geographic location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only
about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has
no domestic energy sources. The economy is dependent on foreign trade,
manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism; the
state-owned Malta drydocks employs about 3,800 people. In 1996,
approximately 1 million tourists visited the island. Per capita GDP of
$12,900 places Malta in the range of the less affluent EU countries.
The island is divided politically over the question of joining the EU.

@Man, Isle of:Economy

Economy-overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key
sectors of the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives
to high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on
the island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in
high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the
mainstays of the economy, have declined in their shares of GDP.
Banking and other services now contribute more than half to GDP. Trade
is mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU
markets.

@Marshall Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: US Government assistance is the mainstay of the
economy, constituting an important supplement to GDP. Agricultural
production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important
commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit.
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and
copra. The tourist industry, now a small source of foreign exchange
employing less than 10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for
future added income. The islands have few natural resources, and
imports far exceed exports. The government is drafting economic
reforms designed to increase revenue and compensate for reductions in
US Government grants-in FY95/96, the US Government provided grants of
$68 million, equal to roughly 70% of the country's GDP. More than 25%
of the government's FY95/96 budget was devoted to debt repayment. In
1996, efforts to stabilize the economy included a 27% reduction in the
government's work force and a 10% cut in the budget.

@Martinique:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism,
and light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of GDP and the
small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has declined, with
most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana
exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat,
vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a
chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from
France. Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as
a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is
employed in the service sector and in administration.

@Mauritania:Economy

Economy-overview: A majority of the population still depends on
agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the
nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by
recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive
deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.
The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks
in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners
threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater
port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and
economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of
foreign debt. The government has begun the second stage of an economic
reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF, and major
donor countries. Short-term growth prospects are poor because of the
heavy debt service burden, rapid population growth, and vulnerability
to climatic conditions.

@Mauritius:Economy

Economy-overview: Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed
from a low income, agriculturally based economy to a middle income
diversified economy with growing industrial, financial services, and
tourist sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been of the
order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in
increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much
improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the
cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export earnings. The
government's development strategy centers on industrialization (with a
view to modernization and to exports), agricultural diversification,
and tourism. Economic performance in 1991-97 continued strong with
solid growth and low unemployment.

Economy-overview: Economic activity is based primarily on the
agricultural sector, including fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte
is not self-sufficient and must import a large portion of its food
requirements, mainly from France. The economy and future development
of the island are heavily dependent on French financial assistance, an
important supplement to GDP. Mayotte's remote location is an obstacle
to the development of tourism.

@Mexico:Economy

Economy-overview: Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of
modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated
by the private sector. The number of state-owned enterprises in Mexico
has fallen from more than 1,000 in 1982 to fewer than 200 in 1998. The
ZEDILLO administration is privatizing and expanding competition in sea
ports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity, natural gas
distribution, and airports. The Mexican economy is in its third year
of recovery from the recession of 1995, which was touched off by a
financial crisis. After declining 6.2% in 1995, real GDP grew 5.1% in
1996 and 7.3% in 1997 and is expected to rise by 5% in 1998. A strong
export sector helped to cushion the economy's decline in 1995 and led
the recovery in 1996 and 1997. Private consumption spending in 1998
probably will rise by at least 4% on the strength of increased
employment and rising real wages, and the troubled banking sector is
likely to increase lending for the first time in three years. Despite
the spillover from the Asian crisis, the medium-term outlook for
Mexico remains positive, with government and private sector economists
projecting average annual growth of 4% to 5% through the year 2000.
Mexico still needs to overcome many structural problems as it strives
to modernize its economy and raise living standards. Income
distribution is very unequal with the top 20% of income earners
accounting for 55% of income. The inefficient agricultural sector
employs 20% to 25% of the labor force but produces only 8% of GDP.
Trade with the United States and Canada has nearly doubled since NAFTA
was implemented in 1994. Mexico is pursuing additional trade
agreements with most countries in Latin America and with the European
Union to lessen its dependence on the United States, which accounts
for 80% of Mexico's total trade.

@Micronesia, Federated States of:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence
farming and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth
exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a
tourist industry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack
of adequate facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from
the US is the primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend
$1 billion in the islands in the 1990s. Geographical isolation and a
poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term
growth.

@Moldova:Economy

Economy-overview: Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland
but has no major mineral deposits. As a result, the economy depends
heavily on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and
tobacco. Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and
natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy shortages contributed to
sharp production declines after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
1991. The Moldovan Government has recently been making progress on an
ambitious economic reform agenda. As part of its reform efforts,
Moldova introduced a stable convertible currency, freed all prices,
stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and backed
steady land privatization, removed export controls, and freed interest
rates. The IMF has suspended payment on Moldova's Extended Fund
Facility since November 1997, due to concerns about the budget deficit
and money supply growth. In late December Parliament agreed to a lower
1998 budget deficit to address IMF and World Bank concerns.

@Monaco:Economy

Economy-overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast,
is a popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant
climate. The Principality has successfully sought to diversify into
services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The
state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax
haven both for individuals who have established residence and for
foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. About 55%
of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
banks, and the industrial sector. Living standards are high, roughly
comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.

@Mongolia:Economy

Economy-overview: The government has embraced free-market economics,
freezing spending, easing price controls, liberalizing domestic and
international trade. Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population,
and wide expanses of unproductive land, however, have constrained
economic development. Economic activity traditionally has been based
on agriculture and the breeding of livestock. In past years, extensive
mineral resources had been developed with Soviet support; total Soviet
assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP, but disappeared
almost overnight in 1990-91. The mining and processing of coal,
copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part
of industrial production. The Mongolian leadership has been soliciting
support from foreign donors, who pledged some $250 million in aid in
October 1997. Economic growth picked up in 1997 after stalling in 1996
due to a series of natural disasters and declines in world prices of
copper and cashmere.

@Montserrat:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy of this volcanic island is small and
open, with economic activity centered on tourism and related services.
Tourism accounts for roughly one-quarter of Montserrat's national
income. The island's main export is electronic components, which are
mainly shipped to the US. The agriculture sector is small; cabbages,
carrots, cucumbers, and onions are grown for the domestic market;
additionally, some hot peppers and live plants are exported to the US
and Europe. Volcanic activity in mid-1997 led to a substantial
evacuation of the southern half of the island, including the capital,
Plymouth. Volcanic activity since July 1995 has resulted in the
departure of an estimated 8,000 people, mainly to Antigua and
Guadeloupe.

@Morocco:Economy

Economy-overview: Morocco faces the problems typical of developing
countries-restraining government spending, reducing constraints on
private activity and foreign trade, and keeping inflation within
manageable bounds. Since the early 1980s the government has pursued an
economic program toward these objectives with the support of the IMF,
the World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The dirham is now
fully convertible for current account transactions; reforms of the
financial sector have been implemented; and state enterprises are
slowly being privatized. Drought conditions in 1997 depressed activity
in the key agricultural sector, holding down exports and contributing
to a 2.2% contraction in real GDP. Favorable rainfalls in the fall of
1997 have led to forecasts of robust, 8%-9% real GDP growth in 1998.
Servicing the external debt, preparing the economy for freer trade
with the European Union, improving education and living standards, and
finding jobs for Morocco's youthful population remain long-term
challenges.

@Mozambique:Economy

Economy-overview: Before the peace accord of October 1992, Mozambique
had been devastated by civil war and was one of the poorest countries
on the globe. Prospects subsequently improved, and with its solid
economic performance in 1996-97, Mozambique has begun to exploit its
sizable agricultural, hydropower, and transportation resources.
Foreign assistance programs help supply the foreign exchange required
to support the budget and pay for imports of goods and services. The
restoration of electrical transmission lines to South Africa and the
completion of a new transmission line to Zimbabwe (permitting the
giant Cahora Bassa hydropower plant to export large amounts of
electricity), proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline to South
Africa, and reform of transportation services will greatly improve
foreign exchange receipts. The Mozambique and South African
Governments are developing the Maputo corridor, linking the port of
Maputo with Witbank, South Africa. In the past few years, more than
700 state enterprises have been privatized, including the country's
largest commercial bank and a number of sizable manufacturing firms.
Other pending reform measures are the reform of tax collection and the
facilitation of private enterprise in the transportation, energy, and
telecommunications sectors.

@Namibia:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction
and processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 20% of GDP.
Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa
and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Rich alluvial
diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin,
silver, and tungsten. Half of the population depends on agriculture
(largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must
import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is three to six times
the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of
Namibia's people live in pronounced poverty because of the great
inequality of income distribution and the large amounts going to
foreigners. The Namibian economy has close links to South Africa.

@Nauru:Economy

Economy-overview: Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the
reserves of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000.
Phosphates have given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes
in the Third World, but incomes probably will drop sharply in the
future. Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be
imported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of
mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
long-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are
invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition. However,
dividends from the trusts have declined sharply since 1990 and the
government has been borrowing heavily from the trusts to finance
fiscal deficits. In an effort to stem further escalation of fiscal
problems, the government has called for a freeze on wages for two
years, a reduction of over-staffed public service departments, drastic
cutbacks in hiring new government staff, privatization of numerous
government agencies, and closure of some overseas consulates.

@Nepal:Economy

Economy-overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed
countries in the world with more than half of its population living
below the poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting
for 40% of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of
agricultural produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain.
Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted
for about 80% of foreign exchange earnings in the past two years.
Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural
resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
is growing by about 5% on average as compared with annual population
growth of 2.5%. Since May 1991, the government has been moving forward
with economic reforms particularly those that encourage trade and
foreign investment, e.g., by eliminating business licenses and
registration requirements in order to simplify investment procedures.
The government has also been cutting expenditures by reducing
subsidies, privatizing state industries, and laying off civil
servants. More recently, however, political instability - five
different governments over the past few years-has hampered Kathmandu's
ability to forge consensus to implement key economic reforms. Nepal
has considerable scope for accelerating economic growth by exploiting
its potential in hydropower and tourism, areas where there has
recently been foreign investment interest. Prospects for foreign trade
or investment in other areas will remain poor, however, because of the
small size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its
remoteness, its landlocked geographic location, and its susceptibility
to natural disaster. The international community's role of funding
more than 60% of Nepal's development budget and more than 28% of total
budgetary expenditures will likely continue as a major ingredient of
growth.

@Netherlands:Economy

Economy-overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based
on private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt,
however, through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare
programs affecting most aspects of economic activity. Industrial
activity features food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking. The
highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor
force but provides large surpluses for export and the domestic
food-processing industry. Indeed, the Netherlands ranks third
worldwide in value of agricultural exports, behind the US and France.
Sharp cuts in subsidy and social security spending have been
accompanied by sustained growth in output and employment. Growth in
1998 should be a brisk 3.5%. The Dutch will almost certainly qualify
for the first wave of countries entering the European Monetary Union
(EMU) in 1999.

@New Caledonia:Economy

Economy-overview: New Caledonia has more than 20% of the world's known
nickel resources. In recent years, the economy has suffered because of
depressed international demand for nickel, the principal source of
export earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for
cultivation, and food accounts for about 25% of imports. In addition
to nickel, financial support from France and tourism are key to the
health of the economy. The outlook for 1998 is clouded by the
spillover of financial problems in East Asia and by lower expected
prices for nickel.

@New Zealand:Economy

Economy-overview: Since 1984 the government has accomplished major
economic restructuring, moving an agrarian economy dependent on a
concessionary British market access toward a more industrialized, free
market economy that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has
boosted real incomes, broadened and deepened the technological
capabilities of the industrial sector, and contained inflationary
pressures. Business confidence strengthened in 1994, and export demand
picked up in the Asia-Pacific region, resulting in 6.2% growth. Growth
continued strong in 1995, but tailed off in 1996-97. Inflation remains
among the lowest in the industrial world. Per capita GDP has been
moving up to the levels of the big West European economies. However,
the Asian economic crisis may slow GDP growth in 1998.

@Nicaragua:Economy

Economy-overview: The Nicaraguan economy, devastated during the 1980s
by economic mismanagement and civil war, is beginning to rebound. In
1991 President CHAMORRO launched an ambitious economic stabilization
program that reduced inflation and obtained substantial economic aid
from abroad. Economic growth rose sharply in 1995-97, due to surges in
exports and efforts to enhance trade liberalization. The program,
however, hit some snags, and a 1994-97 IMF Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) signed by the CHAMORRO administration with
the Fund lapsed in September 1996 due to non-compliance. In 1997,
however, the IMF resumed negotiations for an ESAF with the ALEMAN
administration, and agreed to an ESAF in 1998. IMF approval of the
ESAF cleared the way for debt relief by the Paris Club later that year
and has opened the way for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative. Implementation of a 1997 property
accord-designed to resolve conflict over properties confiscated by the
Sandinistas in the 1980s-should also help inspire international
investor confidence. Strong growth is forecast for 1998, with
implementation of a 1997 free trade agreement with Mexico expected to
boost agricultural exports, although the industrial sector may come
under pressure from increased Mexican competition.

@Niger:Economy

Economy-overview: Niger is a poor, landlocked Sub-Saharan nation,
whose economy centers on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry,
reexport trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its major export
since the 1970s. Terms of trade with Nigeria, Niger's largest regional
trade partner, have improved dramatically since the 50% devaluation of
the West African franc in January 1994; this devaluation boosted
exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of Niger's
small cotton industry. The government relies on bilateral and
multilateral aid for operating expenses and public investment and is
strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment programs designed
by the IMF and the World Bank. The US terminated bilateral assistance
to Niger after the coup of 1996. Other donors have reduced their aid.

@Nigeria:Economy

Economy-overview: The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be
hobbled by political instability, corruption, and poor macroeconomic
management. Nigeria's unpopular military rulers have failed to make
significant progress in diversifying the economy away from
overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides 30%
of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 80% of budgetary
revenues. The government's resistance to initiating greater
transparency and accountability in managing the country's multibillion
dollar oil earnings continues to limit economic growth and prevent an
agreement with the IMF and bilateral creditors on debt relief. The
largely subsistence agricultural sector has failed to keep up with
rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of
food, now must import food. Agricultural production in 1996 suffered
from severe shortages of fertilizer, and production of fertilizer fell
even further in 1997.

@Niue:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New
Zealand and remittances as Niue has no indigenous export product.
Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall
made up by grants from New Zealand; the grants are used to pay wages
to public employees. Niue cut government expenditures in 1994-96 by
reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector
consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are
grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to
process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of
postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand. A small
tourist industry is developing.

@Northern Mariana Islands:Economy

Economy-overview: The economy benefits substantially from financial
assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally
generated government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years
1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital
development, government operations, and special programs. Since 1992,
funding has been extended one year at a time. The commonwealth
received $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96. For FY96/97
through FY02/03, funding of $11 million will be provided for
infrastructure, with an equal local match. A rapidly growing chief
source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%
of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
Garment production is the fastest growing industry with employment of
12,000 mostly Chinese workers and shipments of $800 million to the US
in 1997 under duty and quota exemptions.

@Norway:Economy

Economy-overview: Norway is a prosperous bastion of welfare
capitalism. The economy consists of a combination of free market
activity and government intervention. The government controls key
areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state
enterprises), and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and
areas with sparse resources. Norway maintains an extensive welfare
system that helps propel public sector expenditures to more than 50%
of GDP and results in one of the highest average tax levels in the
world. A small country with a high dependence on international trade,
Norway is basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed
goods, with an abundance of small- and medium-sized firms, and is
ranked among the major shipping nations. The country is richly endowed
with natural resources-petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and
minerals-and is highly dependent on its oil sector. Only Saudi Arabia
exports more oil than Norway. Norway imports more than half its food
needs. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in
November 1994. Economic growth in 1998 should be about the same as in
1997. Inflation probably will move up toward 3% because of tightness
in labor markets. Despite their high per capita income-outstripped
among major nations only by the US-and their generous welfare
benefits, Norwegians worry about that time in the 21st century when
the oil and gas run out.

@Oman:Economy

Economy-overview: Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes
of the oil industry. Petroleum accounts for 75% of export earnings and
government revenues and for roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has proved oil
reserves of 4 billion barrels, equivalent to about 20 years'
production at the current rate of extraction. Agriculture is carried
on at a subsistence level and the general population depends on
imported food. The year 1996 was marked by higher oil production and
prices. The government is encouraging private investment, both
domestic and foreign, as a prime force for further economic
development.

PACIFIC OCEAN

@Pacific Ocean:Geography

Location: body of water between Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and the
Western Hemisphere

Geographic coordinates: 0 00 N, 160 00 W

Area:
total: 165.384 million sq km
note: includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering
Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of
Tonkin, Java Sea, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan,
Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other
tributary water bodies

Area-comparative: about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean
(followed by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic
Ocean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger than the
total land area of the world

Coastline: 135,663 km

Climate: planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns
exhibit remarkable uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and
westerly winds are well-developed patterns, modified by seasonal
fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico
from June to October and affect Mexico and Central America;
continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less
pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in
the North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal-a rainy
season occurs during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow
from the ocean over the land, and a dry season during the winter
months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land mass back to the
ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike southeast and East Asia
from May to December

Terrain: surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a
clockwise, warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in
the southern Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the
northern Pacific, sea ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk
in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea ice from Antarctica reaches
its northernmost extent in October; the ocean floor in the eastern
Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western
Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Mariana Trench,
which is the world's deepest

Elevation extremes:
lowest point: Mariana Trench -10,924 m
highest point: sea level 0 m

Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and
gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish

Natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the "Pacific Ring of
Fire"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east
Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to October);
tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August
and September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from
Antarctica; cyclical El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru,
when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent
moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary food source for
anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better feeding grounds,
causing resident marine birds to starve by the thousands because of
the loss of their food source; ships subject to superstructure icing
in extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to
October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime
hazard from June to December

Environment-current issues: endangered marine species include the
dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution
in Philippine Sea and South China Sea

Environment-international agreements:
party to: none of the selected agreements
signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements

Geography-note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama
Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the

@Pacific Ocean:Economy

Economy-overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the
world economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly
touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and
sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%)
of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the
only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.
Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China,
US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,
combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has
slowed but not stopped new drillings.

@Pakistan:Economy

Economy-overview: Pakistan continues to suffer through a damaging
foreign exchange crisis. The crisis stems from years of loose fiscal
policies that exacerbated inflation and allowed the public debt, money
supply, and current account deficit to explode. In April 1997, Prime
Minister SHARIF introduced a stimulus package of tax cuts intended to
boost failing industrial output and spur export growth. At that time,
the IMF endorsed the program, paving the way for a $1.5 billion
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Although the economy showed
signs of improvement following the measures, SHARIF has refused to
implement the tough structural reforms necessary for sustained,
longer-term growth. As a consequence, at yearend 1997, industrial
production continued to flag, foreign exchange reserves continued to
teeter around $1 billion-only four weeks of imports-and borrowing to
support the budget deficit already exceeded the amount allocated for
the entire fiscal year. At the same time, the government must cope
with long-standing economic vulnerabilities-inadequate infrastructure,
low levels of literacy, and increasing sectarian, ethnic, and tribal
violence.
